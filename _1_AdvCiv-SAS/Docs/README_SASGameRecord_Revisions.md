# SASGameRecord Revision History

> Historical reconstruction from the AdvCiv-SAS commit-diff corpus, reconciled through practical version 6439 (`03b44b8932a0715be234e8c5332fcb8a1d1cf3b2`).

## Revision policy

`SASGameRecord` uses one monotonically increasing **revision** number as a downstream-update signal, not as a compatibility promise. The purpose is simple: an external mod/parser/tool that supports revision N and encounters N+1 knows that the official SASGameRecord implementation changed and should review/update its copy.

- Increment the revision for every intentional SASGameRecord-related code change that a downstream copy may want to review: emitted data/semantics, row/field names, recording conditions, recorder bug fixes, relevant bridges/call sites/configuration/checkers, implementation/refactors/optimizations, and code comments or provenance headers in those implementation files. The goal is deliberately simple: if the official SASGameRecord-related code changed, a copied implementation can notice that there is something new to review.
- Do **not** spend time deciding whether a change is backward-compatible or behavior-changing. When in doubt, increment.
- Do not increment for standalone documentation/history edits, refreshed example logs/screenshots/packages, or unrelated gameplay commits that merely used SASGameRecord as validation evidence.
- Multiple SASGameRecord changes deliberately combined in one Git commit are one revision; this is an update counter, not a hunk/field counter.
- The official revision sequence belongs to SASGameRecord. A downstream mod should report the highest official revision it has implemented and should not invent official revision numbers for private extensions.

## Current reconstructed number and first explicit marker

The original reconstruction counted **67 implementation-changing commits** from the feature introduction at SAS practical 6022 through practical 6438.

Under the stricter maintenance rule above, practical 6439 also counts because it intentionally changed the provenance/header comments in the dedicated `sas_game_record_log.py` checker. Practical 6440 then introduced the explicit revision mechanism itself and therefore counts as the next implementation change.

Therefore:

- **Historical state at practical 6438 / Git `6673cf44...`: revision 67.**
- **Historical state at practical 6439: revision 68.**
- **The commit that introduces the explicit revision field/history/check should be revision 69**, because the mechanism itself changes SASGameRecord-related code.

Current emitted source-context field:

```text
GAME_RECORD_SOURCE_CONTEXT recordRevision=75 ...
```

After this, each qualifying SASGameRecord update increments `SAS_GAME_RECORD_REVISION` by one and adds one short latest-first entry to this file in the same commit. The revision is only a downstream-update signal; exact runtime source identity remains in `GAME_RECORD_SOURCE_CONTEXT`.

## Reconstruction method

The history below counts commits that changed the recorder implementation itself (`SASGameSummaryLog.*` / `SASGameRecordLog.*`) or changed runtime/configuration call sites directly participating in the structured record. It intentionally excludes broad text-search hits that only mentioned the record in documentation/comments, used it as test evidence, refreshed example logs, or changed packaging/tooling without changing the recorder implementation. This is why the original reconstruction produced 67 revisions through practical 6438 rather than the much noisier ~166 broad-history-hit figure. The stricter current policy additionally counts later intentional code-comment/header-only updates in SASGameRecord-related implementation/checker files.

Because this numbering is reconstructed after the fact, the descriptions are concise summaries of the canonical commit diffs/messages rather than claims that these revision numbers were emitted by historical builds.

## History (latest first)

### Revision 75 - SAS practical 6460

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Change:** Added compact periodic naval-assault posture covering assault lift/capacity/loading, current open-ocean capability, fleet-group loading/base-location/mission/support state and exact transported unit composition; also recorded the SAS UWAI naval-logistics deployment gameplay toggle in the canonical war-AI settings row.

### Revision 74 - SAS practical 6455

- **Date:** 2026-09-14
- **Change:** Added one compact all-city `CITY_PRODUCTION_NO_TARGET` outcome at control-path-aware turn boundaries. Manual human cities are sampled before end-turn production processing, while AI-controlled and production-automated cities are sampled afterward; disorder is suppressed, and detailed legality/chooser-path evidence is kept in the dedicated BBAI category.

### Revision 73 - SAS practical 6446

- **Date:** 2026-09-12
- **Change:** Canonicalized invalid `TEAM_MET` first-contact coordinate pairs as `-1,-1` instead of serializing values that are undefined when their validity flags are false; ordinary valid coordinates and gameplay behavior are unchanged.

### Revision 72 - SAS practical 6443

- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Change:** Added exact level-3 plot-ownership transition history with conservative immediate mechanism/source provenance, expanded causal transactions across city founding/culture expansion/flips, war/peace, vassalage and direct Python/WorldBuilder ownership chains, and extended CORE plot fingerprints with contested second-owner/forced-unowned state.

### Revision 71 - SAS practical 6442

- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Git commit:** `ac49c56121108e58b021d9bd127440ad03d68700`
- **Change:** Added compact level-3 semantic CORE state checkpoints at the existing authoritative-RNG lifecycle boundaries, with component/combined fingerprints, latent gameplay/AI state and measured computation time; extended the RNG comparison helper to validate and localize first RNG-versus-state divergence.

### Revision 70 - SAS practical 6441

- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Git commit:** `e7c316b1988fca98dc8baa1271ab47049b26d2d0`
- **Change:** Added session-local monotonic `seq` identity to every emitted structured `GAME_RECORD_*` row and generic causal `tx` scopes, initially bracketing city acquisition/raze so filtered records retain exact chronology and related city-transfer consequences remain explicitly joinable.

### Revision 69 - SAS practical 6440

- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Git commit:** `9337aece920266486be61a7bf60ec9f96e406bb9`
- **Change:** Added the explicit emitted `GAME_RECORD_SOURCE_CONTEXT recordRevision` field, public `SAS_GAME_RECORD_REVISION` constant, committed revision history, maintenance guidance, and consistency checks so downstream copies can cheaply detect any later official SASGameRecord-related code update.

### Revision 68 - SAS practical 6439

- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Git commit:** `03b44b8932a0715be234e8c5332fcb8a1d1cf3b2`
- **Change:** Standardized provenance headers across active AdvCiv-SAS files, including the SASGameRecord implementation, comparison helper and dedicated build checker. Runtime recorder behavior was unchanged, but the SASGameRecord-related code artifacts changed and therefore count under the current strict revision policy.

### Revision 67 - SAS practical 6438

- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Git commit:** `6673cf44c57730764b1da664e24673c9bd68a835`
- **Change:** Added level-3 authoritative map/synchronized RNG checkpoints with call/fingerprint/stream provenance, corrected session-rollover finalization, and added the SASGameRecord RNG comparison/validation helper.

### Revision 66 - SAS practical 6437

- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Git commit:** `c6d05a34b95b9da2df330d9c4ab537527310933c`

- **Date:** 2026-09-09
- **Git commit:** `22aec5ffbb588a2d280e8a68480d1195642c3c87`

## Maintenance template

For the next qualifying committed update, increment the public source constant and prepend one entry like this:

```markdown
### Revision N - SAS practical XXXX

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Change:** Briefly state what changed in SASGameRecord-related code and why a downstream copy should review/update.
```

Do not try to place the final SHA of the same not-yet-created commit into its own history entry: changing the document would change that SHA again. Historical entries can retain already-known SHAs, while current runtime Git/source identity is recorded independently by `GAME_RECORD_SOURCE_CONTEXT`.

Standalone docs/history/example-log/package-only updates do not bump the revision. If a qualifying code change and those maintenance files are committed together, they remain one revision.
