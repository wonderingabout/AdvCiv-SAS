# AdvCiv-SAS DLL Compilation Guide

This documents the tested local command-line Release-build workflow primarily for LLM/AI helpers operating through a terminal. Human modders can usually open [`AdvCiv.vcxproj`](/CvGameCoreDLL/Project/AdvCiv.vcxproj) directly with tools like Visual C++ 2010 Express and build the Release configuration through the IDE instead, as used for AdvCiv-SAS development. The clean-target, output-verification, installation, testing and symbol-retention rules below still apply to either approach.

By default, AI helpers should let the user compile unless compilation is needed or the user agrees that the helper may do it.

## Toolchain layout

Visual C++ 2010 Express supplies the IDE, `vcvars32.bat` environment, and `nmake.exe` build driver. The actual Civ4 DLL is compiled and linked with Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 for Civ4 compatibility.

[`AdvCiv.vcxproj`](/CvGameCoreDLL/Project/AdvCiv.vcxproj) is mainly an NMake wrapper, so it does not list every SDK/library path directly:

- [`Makefile.user`](/CvGameCoreDLL/Project/Makefile.user) sets `TOOLKIT` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Civ4SDK\Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003` and `PSDK` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Civ4SDK\WindowsSDK`.
- The main [`Makefile`](/CvGameCoreDLL/Project/Makefile) uses the Toolkit 2003 `cl.exe` and `link.exe`, plus the Windows SDK resource compiler.
- The system environment variable `CIV4_LIB_INSTALL_PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Civ4Libs` supplies the Boost 1.32.0 and Python24 headers/libraries.

Calling VS2010 `vcvars32.bat` before `nmake` is required for the remaining Visual Studio include environment. A direct `nmake` attempt without it failed on missing `sal.h`.

## Before every full compile attempt

This applies to the first attempt and every retry after a failure:

1. Resolve the exact target folder under [`CvGameCoreDLL/Project/temp_files`](/CvGameCoreDLL/Project/temp_files), e.g. `temp_files/Release` or `temp_files/Debug-opt`.
2. Delete that target folder before compiling or retrying the same configuration. Do not broaden deletion beyond the verified target folder; other configurations are isolated.
3. Keep the parent directory's tracked zero-byte `.gitkeep`. It preserves the empty workflow folder in fresh Git clones and anchors the repository hygiene check.

Stale fast-build intermediates have produced unreliable DLL behavior in testing. A one-file retry may be useful only to diagnose a compiler failure; afterward, delete that target folder before retrying the full build. Do not accept a DLL resumed from partial intermediates after a failed attempt. Retaining `temp_files/Debug-opt` is useful after a successful build, but it must be deleted before the next Debug-opt compile; it does not affect a clean Release build.

## Release compile command

Run this PowerShell command with `CvGameCoreDLL\Project` as the working directory:

```powershell
cmd.exe /d /s /c 'call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat" >nul && set "TARGET=Release" && "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\nmake.exe" source_list /NOLOGO && "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\nmake.exe" fastdep /NOLOGO && "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\nmake.exe" dll /NOLOGO'
```

Verification on 2026-08-14: from a missing/clean `temp_files/Release` target, this completed a full Release compile and link in about 106 seconds. Full builds on this machine generally take about 1 minute 30 seconds to 1 minute 42 seconds; allow about 2 minutes before treating quiet/buffered output as hung or timing it out.

The command writes `CvGameCoreDLL\Project\Release\CvGameCoreDLL.dll`. Verify successful command output/exit status and the updated DLL. Visual Studio/MSBuild builds also write `CvGameCoreDLL\Project\Release\AdvCiv.log`, where success is shown by `Build succeeded.`, but do not assume that direct `nmake` refreshes the IDE build log.

## Install, test, and clean

A successful project build does not by itself install or test the DLL used by the mod.

1. Copy `CvGameCoreDLL\Project\Release\CvGameCoreDLL.dll` to [`Assets/CvGameCoreDLL.dll`](/Assets/CvGameCoreDLL.dll) if the new build should be installed.
2. Verify the copied file (for example, compare source/destination SHA-256 hashes).
3. Launch and test Civ4 as appropriate for the change.
4. After verifying the generated DLL and, when installing it, copying/verifying the installed DLL, the cleanup command below may remove the generated Release target. Keeping another target such as Debug-opt does not affect Release.
5. Before the next Release build, ensure `temp_files/Release` is absent; the parent `.gitkeep` and retained Debug-opt symbols may remain.

```powershell
cmd.exe /d /s /c 'call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat" >nul && set "TARGET=Release" && "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\nmake.exe" clean /NOLOGO'
```

## Retained Debug-opt crash symbols

A clean Debug-opt build writes both `CvGameCoreDLL.dll` and its exact matching `CvGameCoreDLL.pdb` under `CvGameCoreDLL/Project/temp_files/Debug-opt`. The linked DLL records that build-time PDB path. Installing only the DLL in `Assets` while retaining the successful build folder therefore lets automatic WinDbg dump analysis resolve private symbols, source files and line numbers without copying the PDB into `Assets` or manually extending the debugger's symbol path. This was confirmed empirically during KI#475.2: after `temp_files/Debug-opt` was removed, a later matching Debug-opt crash report lost the useful source frames despite copying a PDB beside the installed Assets DLL; retaining the freshly rebuilt target restored them.

Keep the successful `temp_files/Debug-opt` folder while its installed DLL may need crash analysis. The folder is locally Git-ignored because retaining its exact PDB is now the normal Debug-opt workflow. This is not permission to reuse its `.obj`, `.pch`, dependency or linker files for another accepted Debug-opt build: delete the whole `temp_files/Debug-opt` target before every subsequent Debug-opt compile or retry, then create a fresh DLL/PDB pair.

Other `temp_files/<target>` folders remain unignored so stale Release, Debug, Profile or other intermediates are visible in local status. The tracked `.gitkeep` remains for fresh clones and CI, while `.gitattributes` excludes the entire parent from release archives. The light-source ZIP includes only the placeholder, never retained compiler intermediates or private symbols. To preserve symbols beyond the next Debug-opt build, archive the exact DLL/PDB pair outside the repository and explicitly add that archive directory to WinDbg's symbol path when analyzing its matching dump.

### Inspecting a dump from the command line

The x86 console debugger installed with WinDbg can inspect Civ4's full-memory dump directly. This PowerShell command was tested from the repository root during the KI#475.2/KI#475.3 investigation; the matching Debug-opt folder resolved the DLL functions and source lines correctly:

```powershell
$cdbExe = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WindowsApps\cdbX86.exe"
$dumpFile = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Temp\Civ4BeyondSword.exe.dmp"
$symbolDir = (Resolve-Path 'CvGameCoreDLL\Project\temp_files\Debug-opt').Path
& $cdbExe -z $dumpFile -y "$symbolDir;srv*" -c '.ecxr; kb; q'
```

The useful debugger commands are compact:

- `.ecxr` switches to the crashing exception context.
- `kb` prints the symbolic call stack with arguments.
- `.frame N; dv /t` selects a stack frame and shows its typed locals. Debug-opt is optimized, so treat surprising local values as leads rather than authoritative state.
- `dt TypeName address` inspects a typed object, `dd address` displays raw memory and `u FunctionName` disassembles a function when the ordinary stack is insufficient.
- `.reload /f CvGameCoreDLL.dll` forces symbol reloading after correcting the symbol path.

`Civ4BeyondSword.exe.dmp` is replaced by a later crash, so preserve a valuable dump before reproducing another one. The dump, installed DLL and PDB must all belong to the same build; source-line information from a different build is not reliable.

## Transient legacy-compiler failures

During the 2026-08-14 verification, the first full attempt had a silent VC2003 `cl.exe` code-1 failure at unchanged `CyGlobalContextInterface4.cpp`. The exact correctly pathed one-file diagnostic target compiled immediately afterward. Deleting the complete Release target and rerunning the full command then produced a successful DLL.

For a similarly unexplained compiler failure: use a narrow retry only for diagnosis, discard that configuration's partial intermediates, delete its target folder and retry the full build from scratch.
