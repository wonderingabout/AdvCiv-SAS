## How to

A quite easy way to gather the original data with chatgpt 5.1 for example, is, using vs code (or any tool you prefer), to do a global search (see for example [Another example of how to use VS Code global search](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/Modding_Ressources/README.md#another-example-of-how-to-use-vs-code-global-search-also-shows-an-example-of-how-to-also-browse-the-civ4-bug_doc-copy-included-in-our-mod)) for say `<Type>LEADER_` and `<FavoriteReligion>` and then copy paste the results found in civ4leaderheadinfos xml file asking chatgpt to merge them into an .md table. There may be easier ways to do it, but this one is quite effective and worked for me.

More recently, i found or noticed that giving old and new XML files (e.g., `CIV4UnitInfos.xml`) to an LLM or such is enough for it to compile them into a nice .md table comparison or such; there may be other ways too but this seems quite good for example.

## Civs' starting techs rework

As it is too lengthy to put in the [README_Main_Changes_Guide.md](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Main_Changes_Guide.md), here are how we changed the starting civ techs in our mod

### before most recent as of now rework

#### main table (chatgpt 5 written) - before change

Done amazingly by chatgpt 5 (numbers are line in our xml civilization info file as of now), check if accurate and thanks a lot chatgpt 5 and thanks to my prompt and such too

See below in the main table after changes as it includes the before values as well.

### after most recent as of now rework

After a few or quite many back and forth and reviewing rounds with chatgpt 5 which helped me tons but also me hehe and my own ideas but it helped lot too, here are (below) the adjusted starting techs for civs as of now in advciv-sas, written by chatgpt 5. This was mostly to remove/replace old now removed tech_agriculture and tech_the_wheel starters that are now no longer starting techs, as well as quite along with it rebalance it and rework it all. I think the result is really good at least much better than it was check if accurate.

#### main table (chatgpt 5 written with some tweaks from me)

Goals: (1) stay historically/thematically sane, (2) avoid **too many repeats** of the same pair, and (3) **not too many "amazing" pairs** like **Mining+Hunting** (early rush spike) and **Mining+Pottery** (eco+production spike) - while keeping **quite a few enough** for clear identity/variety.

Note: **Fishing+Mining is fine** (Fishing is weakest), so we use it without concern as long as there is not too much of it.

| Civ | Old FreeTechs | New FreeTechs | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| America | Fishing, Agriculture | **Fishing, Hunting** | Drops disallowed Agriculture. Frontier/scouting flavor; modest econ. *Avoids Mining+Hunting / Mining+Pottery.* |
| Arabia | The Wheel, Mysticism | **Hunting, Mysticism** | Desert pastoral/tribal-warrior flavor + smooth path toward Animal Husbandry/camels; Mysticism preserves the religious identity of its Library replacement. |
| Aztec | Mysticism, Hunting | **Mining, Mysticism** | **Jaguar** now at Bronze Working -> Mining speeds access. Mysticism matches ritual/state culture. We **avoid Mining+Hunting** to curb rush. |
| Babylon | Agriculture, The Wheel | **Pottery, Mysticism** | **Bowman** is now **Longbow-class** at Construction. Pottery fits the Masonry -> Construction lane (bricks, aqueducts, Hanging Gardens), while Mysticism preserves the temple/garden flavor. |
| Byzantium | The Wheel, Mysticism | **Mysticism, Fishing** | Bosporus/seaborne empire + spiritual tone; removes early-road snowball. |
| Carthage | Fishing, Mining | **Fishing, Pottery** | Maritime commerce + cottages; **drops Mining** to lower early snowball and reduce pair repetition. |
| Celt | Hunting, Mysticism | **Hunting, Mining** | **Gallic Warrior** metallurgy path justified; shifts from "druidic" to martial. **Intentional strong pair** (Mining+Hunting) for civ-specific unit identity; kept rare overall. |
| China | Agriculture, Mining | **Mining, Pottery** | Bronze/iron + ceramics traditions; we keep this as **one of the few** strong **Mining+Pottery** pairs for identity. |
| Egypt | The Wheel, Agriculture | **Hunting, Pottery** | Keep **Pottery** to flow into **Masonry -> Construction** (builder identity: Pyramids, aqueducts, etc.). Add **Hunting** to align the **War Chariot** path. |
| England | Fishing, Mining | **Keep** | Industrial metals identity fits; Fishing+Mining is acceptable (Fishing is weakest). Also avoids overusing Mining+Pottery. |
| Ethiopia | Hunting, Mining | **Hunting, Mysticism** | Highlands/faith; **removes Mining+Hunting** spike while keeping early defense. |
| Kingdom of Benin | / | **Mysticism, Pottery** | Pottery anchors the "fortified/urban builder court-state" + supports your Impluvium/aqueduct line; Mysticism keeps the ritual/court legitimacy flavor (and avoids pushing them toward early bronze play). |
| France | The Wheel, Agriculture | **Hunting, Pottery** | Aristocratic hunt + towns; replaces disallowed pair. |
| Germany | Pottery, Mining | **Keep** | Crafts + metalwork flexibility. **One of the few** Mining+Pottery we keep (Old World metallurgy). |
| Greece | Fishing, Hunting | **Mining, Mysticism** | Keeps the "culture/religion" signal (temples/oracles/cults) while also pushing the Hoplite -> Bronze/Iron line sooner via Mining; better matches "bronze + sacred polis" as a starter identity. |
| Holy Roman | Mysticism, Hunting | **Mysticism, Pottery** | Reads more like "Church + towns/guild/urban administration" than generic hunting, and unlocks their civ-specific building (Courthouse-based) sooner via the Pottery line. |
| Inca | Agriculture, Mysticism | **Pottery, Mining** | Andean mining/metallurgy (copper, arsenical bronze; large-scale gold/silver extraction) + state logistics makes Mining a great fit. Also supports Quechua @ **Iron Working** |
| India | Mysticism, Mining | **Keep** | Spiritual tradition + engineering; not an "amazing" pair. |
| Ireland | / | **Fishing, Mysticism** | Maritime + monastic/cultural identity; balanced opener without Mining/Hunting spikes. |
| Japan | Fishing, The Wheel | **Fishing, Hunting** | Keeps maritime identity; **Jomon hunter-gatherer** roots make Hunting plausible. Avoids adding another Mining+Pottery or Mining+Hunting. |
| Khmer | Hunting, Mining | **Fishing, Hunting** | Tonle Sap/Mekong fisheries + elephants/camps; **removes Mining+Hunting** rush spike. |
| Korea | Mining, Mysticism | **Fishing, Mining** | Keeps Mining (the more distinctive "Korea-coded" pillar: metals/engineering), and adds Fishing to reflect a peninsula/coastal civilization with strong maritime/trade exposure - without implying an early religion-race start. |
| Mali | The Wheel, Mining | **Hunting, Pottery** | **Skirmisher** is now **Longbow-class** at Construction. Hunting keeps the Sahel skirmisher/camp identity; Pottery sustains early commerce while beelining Construction. They don't need mining as much for their civ-specific unit. |
| Maya | Mining, Mysticism | **Mysticism, Pottery** | Classic Maya = obsidian/chert/jade; metals are late/minor. Early Pottery better fits their builder profile, gives the Quick Worker immediate Cottage access, and ramps Ball Court @ Construction, while Mysticism matches ritual/astronomy and supplies early culture. |
| Mongol | The Wheel, Hunting | **Hunting, Mysticism** | Pastoral steppe with early horses: Hunting -> Animal Husbandry -> Mounted Combat (and Barracks @ Hunting in AdvCiv-SAS), which also matches their aggressive-leaning leader profiles; Mysticism reflects Tengri/shamanic cohesion and supplies early culture/monuments to claim steppe space. |
| Native America | Agriculture, Fishing | **Hunting, Mining** | Replace inland Fishing with Mining (abstracts obsidian/flint/quarries). **Dog Soldier** benefits from the Bronze Working line. Adds one OP pair by design; helps identity. |
| Netherlands | Agriculture, Fishing | **Fishing, Pottery** | Maritime commerce + early cottages; *no Mining* for a gentler opener. |
| Ottoman | The Wheel, Agriculture | **Fishing, Pottery** | **Fishing** to reflect an early maritime footprint on the **Aegean**, **Sea of Marmara** (Bosporus), **Black Sea**, and the **eastern Mediterranean**. Pair with **Pottery** to support early crafts/urbanization and a builder-empire profile. They don't need as much strong starting techs for their civ-specific unit that is later in the game. |
| Persia | Agriculture, Hunting | **Hunting, Mining** | Nearer to **Iron Working** path in your tree; strong metallurgy tradition. We accept one more OP pair for identity; totals remain balanced. |
| Portugal | Fishing, Mining | **Fishing, Pottery** | Age-of-Discovery maritime commerce; Mining ceded to reduce repetition and fund other civs' thematic needs. |
| Rome | Fishing, Mining | **Keep** | Metals for **Legionary** timing; avoids Hunting and Mining+Pottery extremes. |
| Russia | Hunting, Mining | **Pottery, Mining** | Land-empire emphasis (settlement/crafts) and less "fishy" opening. Keeps metal identity; also offsets Ottoman's change to keep 14/14/14/14/14 totals. |
| Spain | Fishing, Mysticism | **Keep** | Maritime reach + organized religion; avoids Mining spikes. |
| Sumeria | Mysticism, Pottery | **Mysticism, Mining** | **Vulture** (axe) loves metals; still not the "amazing" Mining+Pottery/Hunting. |
| Scandinavia | Fishing, Hunting | **Keep** | Seafaring + raiding/hunting; balanced opener without Mining; keeps variety. |
| Zulu | Agriculture, Hunting | **Hunting, Mining** | **Intentionally keep an OP pair (Mining+Hunting)** for **Impi** flavor/identity; brings Agriculture into compliance. |

#### Global tech totals

| Tech | Count |

| Hunting + Mysticism | 3     |
| Hunting + Pottery   | 3     |
| Fishing + Mysticism | 3     |

**Sanity checks:**

- Pair counts sum to **36** civs.  
- Tech totals sum to **72** picks. OK

## Civ-specific buildings rework

No counts yet (faster pass).  

Note: water buildings are generally avoided as they are too situational (useless in land maps or cities, etc.) and often weaker, unless they strongly fit or well enough.

| Civ | Before (Base AdvCiv) | After (AdvCiv-SAS) | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| America | Mall (Supermarket) | **Federal Courthouse** (Courthouse) | The Mall arrives too late to shape most games, while the federal court system is a strong thematic part of American history. Lower construction and maintenance costs represent shared national institutions, administrative overlap and economies of scale across states, helping the commonly large American empires in gameplay integrate new or conquered cities. Espionage defense represents federal legal oversight and the broader national-security role of resisting foreign infiltration or sabotage (thematically ties to FBI/CIA/NSA and strong USA security importance theme i guess too), supporting defensive strategies without adding another economic bonus. The Rathaus remains stronger at permanently reducing maintenance, preserving its distinct advantage. |
| Arabia | Madrassa (Library) | **Furusiyya Maydan** (Stable) | Saladin's military and religious profile should not be forced into a science-specialist path merely to access its civ-specific effects. A Stable instead provides direct early mounted training before the Hajjan while Priest slots preserve his religious identity. "Maydan" presents it as a riding/training ground rather than another academic school like the old Madrassa. Conditional Health from Horse and Camel complements Saladin's Charismatic Happiness by letting cities grow further toward their higher Happiness limit, keeps both mounted bonuses useful beyond their military windows, and expresses Arabian horsemanship, cavalry and purebred Arabian horse traditions without adding another raw mounted-unit bonus. |
| Aztec | Sacrificial Altar (Courthouse) | **Keep** (Monument) | Move it much earlier so the Aztecs can benefit from Slavery during their ancient military window. Avoid an early specialist (artist for ceremonial theme) effect that could make the cheap building disproportionately strong for border pressure and Great Person generation. Happiness with Maize instead reinforces the Aztec Slavery economy: the Granary already grants Health with Maize, while its retained Food accelerates population regrowth after repeated whipping, making the bonus more strategically important to the Aztecs than to the Maya, on top of being a thematic fit (Americas' food). |
| Babylon | Garden (Colosseum) | **Keep** (Granary) | A Garden fits poorly as a public-entertainment Colosseum and better supports Babylon's ancient agricultural and fertile-city identity through early growth infrastructure. Modest permanent Health ensures that the Garden remains distinct without accelerating early growth as directly as flat Food, while conditional cultivated-bonus Health and Happiness add gradual scaling. The Granary's retained Food helps Hammurabi recover population after Slavery or military expansion. Since Hammurabi/Babylon is not a stark trader nor warmonger, this gives him a balanced middle ground to sustain various strategies. |
| Byzantium | Hippodrome (Theatre) | **Keep** (Stable) | Stable is more useful for the strong civ-specific Cataphract. Replacing the old Theatre-like culture-slider happiness with war-weariness reduction better matches this military role, while public games provide the thematic wartime-morale link. Its early technology requirement also makes it likely to be built before the Cataphract becomes available. |
| Carthage | Cothon (Harbor) | **Punic Agora** (Grocer) | Replace a coastal and map-dependent building with Carthage's civic-commercial marketplace. Retaining the Grocer's Health and Happiness supports Charismatic city growth, while stronger Gold specialization and Merchant access support Hannibal's commercial profile without multiplying all Commerce or depending on foreign trade. Considering caste system is soon or nearby, rendering Merchants cheap enough to access, the stronger gold modifier feels justified. The accumulated wealth remains useful for peaceful Research or military expansion, and the later timing than a Market permits a stronger Gold modifier. |
| Celt | Dun (Walls) | **La Tene Smithy** (Forge) | Dun is weak and too defensive/situational; also doesn't match the aggressive Celtic profile. Shift to a Forge-based UB for a stronger metalwork identity, with happiness support tied to Iron/Copper. Good synergy with their swordsman-based civ-specific unit and overall military profile that may use these bonuses as well. |
| China | Pavillion (Theatre) | **Changpingcang** (Market) | Not so cultural game profile plus it is weaker. This new building leans into a market-management/state-stability theme (price smoothing and social calm) rather than pure food storage. As China in this setup is often health-rich, extra happiness support is valuable and a nice synergy for larger empires and sustained city growth. Identity with happy from Rice capitalizes on such excess health, and food kept fits thematically and is not as op later in the game. |
| Egypt | Obelisk (Monument) | **Keep** (Keep) | |
| England | Stock Exchange (Bank) | **Keep** (Keep) | The strong and versatile early Yeoman Archer gives England a meaningful civ-specific advantage well before the late Stock Exchange, making the building's timing sustainable. Intrinsic Great Merchant progress gives this late high-finance building a lasting distinction that cannot be made redundant by unrestricted specialist slots. |
| Ethiopia | Stele (Monument) | **Metsehaf Bet** (Library) | Zara Yaqob's fairly versatile profile benefits from the broadly useful early Library class as a foundation rather than being pushed into a narrow or late building. The Metsehaf Bet distinguishes it through Ethiopia's theology-to-scholarship identity and Ge'ez manuscript/commentary tradition, with a Priest and Culture-scaling profile expressing religious scholarship. This also uses the underused Library slot and declutters the overused Monument slot. Otherwise a more specialized cultural/growth identity and synergy like a Theater-based building may have been worth exploring. |
| Ireland | / | **Muileann Uisce** (Aqueduct) | Ireland's late Flying Column benefits from a meaningful civ-specific building earlier in the game, while neither Irish leader should be forced into the old religious/science path like a Monastic identity building may if added. Irish leaders lean military/econ/spy overall however, so they can use hammer for example. Irish water power adds terrain-dependent Production from worked river plots at a timing late enough to limit early snowballing, and Wheat Happiness connects milling with cereal and ale production. |
| Kingdom of Benin | / | **Impluvium** (Aqueduct) | New civ: Thematic fit; plus fits Ewuare's production/growth profile |
| France | Salon (Observatory) | **Keep** (University) | Observatory removed (to unclutter); thematic fit with Lumieres theme |
| Germany | Assembly Plant (Factory) | **Zunfthaus** (Forge) | Replace a late Factory variant and the overly strong early flat Food of the former SAS Granary design with a versatile craft and manufacturing identity. Stronger general Production and additional Engineer access support both German leaders across infrastructure, military, research, wonder spam, and space goals without forcing a narrow science building. It is also a good thematic fit, and so far varied civ identity/profile not so used by other civilizations, so a more varied alternative that may suit the German mid-game profile. |
| Greece | Odeon (Colosseum) | **Keep** (Theatre) | After the broader building shuffle, Theatre fills an otherwise underused class and frees Colosseum for other civilizations. It also fits an odeon better and sits on the religion/culture technology paths Greece is more likely to use. Happiness and Great Artist generation make this cultural path broadly useful, while Dyes add a bonus-dependent benefit distinct from the Khmer culture-slider identity. |
| Holy Roman | Rathaus (Courthouse) | **Keep** (Keep) | |
| Inca | Terrace (Granary) | **Qullqa** (Keep) | Renaming for thematic fit; rework for historical accuracy and to make it stronger (financial/organized incan economy profile) rather than mixing culture and growth weirdly and in a bit op way. |
| India | Mausoleum (Jail) | **Keep** (Colosseum) | The late Jail's Espionage/security role poorly matched both a monumental Mausoleum and India's kit. The earlier Colosseum sits on the versatile Construction path, supporting infrastructure alongside siege/castle preparation when needed, while its Culture and Happiness let Spiritual Gandhi and Asoka develop religion/culture naturally into peaceful city growth. Gold keeps the stronger Happiness benefit conditional and supports its cultural-wealth identity; also "Mausolleum" and "Colosseum" somehow sounds the same so suitable too perhaps, and may also be a better thematic fit than Jail was. |
| Japan | Shale Plant (Coal Plant) | **Doujou** (Barracks) | A Barracks replacement directly supports Japan's military identity and is available much sooner, making it more impactful than the late Shale Plant. Add building effects that cover Japan's espionage/isolationist and military/martial arts identity (as of now a Spy specialist and Great General modifier). |
| Khmer | Baray (Aqueduct) | **Hall of Dancers** (Theatre) | Replace another mostly generic health building with a more distinctive Khmer ritual-culture identity while helping fill the otherwise underused Theatre class. Suryavarman's Creative/cultural lean can turn cultural investment into Happiness and growth, while Elephants retain ceremonial value after their military window. |
| Korea | Seowon (University) | **Gyeongdang** (Library) | Use a more ancient-coded Korean school identity tied to Korea's long education tradition (Taehak, Gyeongdang, later state academies). The underused Library slot gives Korea an earlier scholarly foundation, while additional Scientist access and basic martial training express combined civil and military education more directly than the former abstract Great General modifier. Keeping the military benefit at the first promotion tier prevents a widely built early building from immediately opening advanced promotion branches. This mostly ubiquitous building may suit versatile strategy players like Zara Yaqob also is and give an early boost for late-game potential comebacks or scaling. |
| Mali | Mint (Forge) | **Keep** (Keep) | |
| Maya | Ball Court (Colosseum) | **Keep** (Keep) | Its strong flat Happiness was too automatic for an early building. Make more of its strength conditional through Gemstones, which can abstract jade and creates a strategic bonus preference matching Maya ritual prestige. |
| Mongol | Ger (Stable) | **Keep** (Keep) | Reduce its excessive mounted experience and add Happiness from Cattle, trading some raw military power for a pastoral/economic benefit that also gives weak livestock more value. A somewhat stronger narrow military Production bonus keeps the Ger's military identity meaningful beside civ-specific buildings with broader Production effects. |
| Native America | Totem (Monument) | **Soldiers' Lodge** (Jail) | The Totem's short-lived early Culture and Merchant effect fits Sitting Bull poorly. Jails arrive soon enough in AdvCiv-SAS for a Soldiers' Lodge to support his strong espionage preference, Philosophical Great Spy route, Protective trait, cautious diplomacy and defensive posture. Stronger active espionage and an additional assignable Spy reward commitment to that route, while counter-intelligence expresses defense through policing, information and internal cohesion rather than further military bonuses. |
| Netherlands | Dike (Levee) | **Beurs** (Bank) | Replace a late and geography-dependent building with a Dutch exchange institution that is useful on every map. Bank timing turns stronger trade-route yield into a substantial strategic investment instead of an automatic effect attached to nearly ubiquitous early infrastructure. A moderate general trade benefit keeps domestic connections useful during war or isolation, while a larger foreign-trade benefit rewards diplomacy and open international markets without being guaranteed. This complements Willem's commercial profile and scales with mature connections, while the strong early Swift Worker sustains the Netherlands before the later building becomes available. An early (and mostly ubiquitous) chassis like the Granary (or Libraries too) would reduce strategic choice and make its compounding effect nearly automatic, so the later Bank is a better fit; plus the late compounding effect on an early building would be weird (although Civ4's Ikhanda does it), so avoid it if possible. |
| Ottoman | Hammam (Aqueduct) | **Keep** (Keep) | Reduce its high cost and make its broadly stronger effects less automatic by moving part of its Happiness to Marble. Marble Health complements the Ottoman Happiness advantage as Health becomes more limiting in larger mid-game cities, while retaining Marble Happiness fits the Hammam's relaxation identity. The result remains generally useful and gives Marble lasting Ottoman value beyond wonder production. |
| Persia | Apothecary (Grocer) | **Keep** (Keep) | Its additional flat Health was useful but plain. Buff and distinguish the Apothecary through stronger Spices Health and Research, making access to medicinal bonuses matter and expressing Persian medicine through both science and economy. |
| Portugal | Feitoria (Custom House) | **Peixaria** (Grocer) | Replace a late and situational naval-trade building with a Grocer that additionally distributes marine bonuses to every city without requiring a coast. Fish and Molluscs support Health while Crab and Whale support Happiness, giving Joao's growing imperial-commercial cities a distinctive bonus objective without another automatic trade modifier. As this keeps a water identity but is buildable in all cities, not just naval ones, this should be significantly stronger and a varied strategy path. Helps sustain Joao's warmonger strategies too if needed as not so much trading leaning. |
| Rome | Forum (Market) | **Keep** (Keep) | Treat the Forum as a place of ideas by reducing its very strong local Great Person (too early) rate modifier and adding a Great Scientist point instead (more useful early, not as impactful late) (also fits "place of ideas" thematically too). This gives gradual progress while remaining strongest in cities committed to Great People; Happiness with Pig adds a conditional benefit and another strategic use for an otherwise weak livestock bonus. |
| Russia | Research Institute (Laboratory) | **Prikaz** (Courthouse) | Replace a late science multiplier with an administrative institution that better supports Russia's large-empire and intelligence profiles. Catherine is a known backstabber/sneaky player, and Peter and Stalin can use Spy effects too. Since Russia is imperalistic quite often or admin/big empire leaning, the normal Courthouse effects keep expansion sustainable, while stronger Espionage makes intelligence a meaningful alternative strategy rather than another Research bonus. |
| Scandinavia | Trading Post (Lighthouse) | **Chieftain's Hall** (Barracks) | Replace a map-dependent naval building with early offensive infrastructure matching Ragnar and the later Viking raider. The first city-raiding promotion creates a distinct offensive retinue identity while normal Barracks experience remains flexible, and modest local War Weariness reduction helps sustain campaigns without becoming a general economic bonus. |
| Spain | Citadel (Castle) | **Lonja** (Market) | Siege experience was an awkward offensive perk on a defensive Castle that an attacking player may not want to build, and the class had a limited useful window. Replace it with a trading institution that supports Spain's imperial-commercial identity throughout the game. Silver Happiness helps Isabella sustain military expansion or peaceful growth, while an additional Trade Route is effective early, remains useful when war disrupts foreign trade and stays distinct from the Dutch scaling trade-route-yield effect. |
| Sumeria | Ziggurat (Courthouse) | **Ziggurat** (Monument) | Much stronger than late courthouse. Fits sumerian early religious/historical/culture profile more; better thematic fit for an ancient civilization, and buffs otherwise very weak livestock bonuses as of now through health from Sheep. |
| Zulu | Ikhanda (Barracks) | **Keep** (Keep) | The city maintenance effect is not that strong early, and the military effect not so strong, but increasing cost makes Shaka significantly less competitive militarily, especially early, so do not increase cost. |

## Unit terrain and feature combat modifiers

Terrain/feature combat effects are mostly a new and currently optional AdvCiv-SAS system. They affect generic as well as civ-specific units, so their shared rationale is documented here instead of being repeated through the civ-specific-unit roster. The four XML categories can be independently enabled or disabled with `SAS_CV_UNIT_INFO_ENABLE_XML_UNIT_TERRAIN_ATTACK_MODIFIERS`, `SAS_CV_UNIT_INFO_ENABLE_XML_UNIT_TERRAIN_DEFENSE_MODIFIERS`, `SAS_CV_UNIT_INFO_ENABLE_XML_UNIT_FEATURE_ATTACK_MODIFIERS`, and `SAS_CV_UNIT_INFO_ENABLE_XML_UNIT_FEATURE_DEFENSE_MODIFIERS` in `GlobalDefines_advciv_sas.xml`.

The goal is historical/thematic identity constrained by gameplay balance: history can suggest *where* a unit should be better or worse, but does not determine an unrestricted numerical bonus. In Civ4 terminology, Grass/Plains/Desert/Tundra/Snow are **terrains**, Forest/Jungle/Flood Plains are **features**, and Hills/Peaks are **plot types**. Hills combat modifiers use separate XML fields; Peak access/movement is likewise a plot-type property rather than a terrain or feature effect. Terrain and Hills combat modifiers use only 10% and 20% tiers, with 20% as the maximum magnitude. Terrain remains under cities and therefore can directly influence city combat, so larger values were too swingy. A 10% value means a minor affinity or weakness; 20% means a strong specialization. As a rough power-budget guideline rather than exact mathematics, two broad 10% affinities can be treated similarly to one more focused 20% affinity.

Features use 10%, 20%, and 40% tiers. Features are removed when a city is founded in the current rules, so feature combat modifiers do not directly amplify city-tile combat and can safely be more situational and more pronounced. 40% is reserved for a defining feature specialization or weakness rather than being a normal civ-specific-unit bonus. Terrain and feature values can stack on the same plot, so large combinations should still be used sparingly.

Generic units normally use the lower tiers. When a civ-specific unit and its generic counterpart share the same terrain/feature identity, the civ-specific unit should normally receive the stronger specialization rather than merely copying the generic value. Attack and defense do not need to mirror each other: offensive/mobile units can specialize on attack, defensive units on defense, and units with `bNoDefensiveBonus` should normally not regain positive explicit terrain/feature defense through these XML modifiers. A small deliberate exception can still be used when holding that specific terrain is part of the unit identity, such as the Camel Archer's minor Desert defense affinity. Negative terrain/feature defense penalties can still be used on such units to represent a genuine disadvantage. City attack/defense modifiers are a separate, more controllable balance system and are not limited by these terrain/feature caps.

Combat-capable civ-specific units are intentionally given at least one **terrain or feature** identity as part of AdvCiv-SAS tactical variety; noncombat civilians are the main exception. Plot-type effects such as Hills combat bonuses or Peak access can complement that identity, but are tracked separately and do not by themselves replace the intended terrain/feature distinction. To keep that identity readable rather than domineering, a civ-specific unit's added positive terrain specialization normally uses either one strong 20% terrain or at most two weak 10% terrains. Relevant affinities or weaknesses already belonging to the generic counterpart can still carry through, and a shared generic affinity can instead be strengthened by the civ-specific unit without counting as another unrelated specialization. Positive terrain defense is often smaller than attack for offensive units (for example, +20% attack / +10% defense). Feature bonuses are budgeted separately because they are narrower and, including Flood Plains in the current rules, disappear under cities; a defining feature specialization can therefore coexist with a small inherited terrain effect. This is a balance guideline rather than a hard XML limit, but it avoids turning historical plausibility into several simultaneous broad bonuses or many tiny modifiers.

Worker-type civilian units intentionally have no terrain/feature combat modifiers while they have no combat strength. If civilian units ever gain a combat role, suitable effects can be reconsidered then rather than carrying currently dead XML data.

Related AI concern (discussion notes kept verbatim for later review):

- Related AI concern. I searched the AI code for explicit use of: getTerrainAttackModifier getTerrainDefenseModifier getFeatureAttackModifier getFeatureDefenseModifier and didn't find those being explicitly evaluated in the *AI.cpp strategic logic. The normal combat calculation absolutely does use them, so when the AI is actually comparing attackers/defenders and combat odds, it should experience their effects correctly. But I don't see evidence that high-level unit valuation/production explicitly says: "this is a jungle-heavy theater, therefore this +40% Jungle UU is especially valuable." That could create a mild human advantage: humans can deliberately exploit these identities while AI mostly discovers them through ordinary tactical odds. I wouldn't rush to “fix” that. The modifiers are much smaller now, and UUs replace normal units anyway. But this is exactly the kind of thing I'd watch with GameRecord/BBAI rather than adding speculative AI logic; to which i replied so far and then "thx glad you like it, also noted your concern on terrain valuation :) i thought we compute str but idk :)".
- then ChatGPT replied this: "Yep xd — and on the terrain valuation point, you were basically right. I checked it more precisely because my previous wording was a little too broad. The actual combat-strength path does account for terrain/feature modifiers. CvUnit::maxCombatStr(...) applies Hills/feature/terrain defense and the attacker's corresponding attack modifiers, and the tactical AI ultimately uses combat odds/strength derived from that. So if a Bowman is fighting on its favored terrain, the AI does understand that this particular fight is better/worse. What I didn't find is the higher-level AI_unitValue / production valuation saying something like: “This unit has +40% Jungle and my theater has tons of Jungle, therefore build more of it.” AI_combatValue itself is basically base combat + first strikes, and AI_unitValue then adds unit-combat counters, city modifiers, collateral, movement, etc.; I still don't see explicit terrain/feature valuation there.So I'd revise my concern to: Tactical valuation: yes, handled. Strategic production valuation of terrain-specialized units: probably not explicitly handled. Which is much less concerning, especially for UUs. The AI doesn't need to perfectly anticipate every situational advantage for the mechanic to work well."

The tables below are an as-of-now review aid rather than a promise that every value is final. `A` means attack and `D` means defense. Units not listed have no terrain/feature/plot-type combat modifier unless noted otherwise.

Note: the current balance is a tamer but more balanced and sometimes more varied (e.g., new Sumerian Vulture Flood Plains effect) version of the old AdvCiv-SAS terrain/feature and such effects, done with the help of ChatGPT-5.6-Sol (i mostly only reviewed or gave a few ideas a bit or such) thanks.

### Animals

Animals use the same caps but are balanced around habitat rather than military-unit roles. Their explicit bonuses are attack-only because animal units use `bNoDefensiveBonus`; the Lion and Bear also lose 1 base strength so their favored habitat restores roughly their former danger instead of simply stacking more power on top.

| Unit | Current terrain/feature effects | Rationale / balance intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lion | Strength 4 -> 3; Plains +20% A; Grass +10% A | Lions are most dangerous in open grassland/savanna-like country; the lower base strength makes that danger localized rather than universal. |
| Bear | Strength 5 -> 4; Forest +20% A | Forest is the Bear's defining habitat, while the lower base strength keeps the specialization close to its old peak rather than making an already strong animal stronger everywhere. |
| Panther | Jungle +20% A | Jungle is the Panther's defining habitat; its existing base strength remains unchanged. |
| Wolf | Snow +20% A; Tundra +10% A | Wolves get a focused cold-climate identity without adding another broad Forest combat package. |

### Generic units

| Unit | Current terrain/feature effects | Rationale / balance intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scout / Explorer | Hills +20% A/D | Hill specialization is a defining exploration/scouting ability and remains within the terrain cap. |
| Axeman | Forest/Jungle +10% A/D | Axes are useful for cutting and clearing wood or dense vegetation both when advancing and when preparing or holding a position, represented by a minor Forest/Jungle affinity. |
| Spearman | Forest/Jungle +10% A/D; Hills +10% A/D | Low-tier rough-ground flexibility gives the early polearm unit some defensive utility without a large specialization. |
| Pikeman | Forest -10% A/D; Jungle -20% A/D; Hills +10% A, +20% D | Long, heavy pikes are awkward to maneuver and bring to bear among trees and dense vegetation, while organized pike formations remain especially effective on defensible hills. |
| Archer | Forest/Jungle +20% A/D; Hills +20% D | Cover and elevation are a major part of the Archer's field-defender identity, but terrain itself stays capped at 20%. |
| Longbowman | Hills +20% D | Keeps the later bow unit's terrain identity focused on elevated defense instead of repeating the Archer's broad feature package. |
| Crossbowman | Hills +10% A/D | Minor hill affinity adds field utility while leaving the generic Crossbowman primarily defined by its unit matchups. |
| Chariot | Forest/Jungle -40% A, -20% D | Wheeled units are highly impractical to maneuver across dense, uneven vegetation, making Chariots especially poor at attacking through Forest and Jungle. |
| Horse Archer | Forest/Jungle -20% D | The horse line is the general-purpose mounted baseline, so it intentionally receives no broad Plains bonus. Plains are common and can affect city combat; adding +10% merely to mirror camels would make the baseline unit broadly stronger, whereas the camel line's Desert bonus is a narrower specialization. |
| Camel Archer | Desert +10% A/D; Forest/Jungle -20% D | A minor Desert attack and defense affinity distinguishes camel-mounted ranged units without turning Desert into a decisive combat multiplier. Camel cavalry and camel-mounted archers historically had strong associations with arid-region warfare and mobility. |
| War Elephant | Plains +10% A; Forest/Jungle -20% A/D | A small open-ground attack benefit contrasts with the difficulty of maneuvering large animals through dense terrain. |
| Horse Knight | Forest/Jungle -20% A/D | Heavy mounted melee remains strong in normal terrain but is meaningfully less effective in dense features. |
| Camel Knight | Desert +10% A; Forest/Jungle -20% A/D | Uses the same heavy-mounted rough-feature weakness as Horse Knight while retaining the camel line's narrow Desert affinity. |
| Horse Cuirassier | Forest/Jungle -20% D | Later mounted-ranged units can still attack from range in rough ground, so only their defensive exposure is penalized. |
| Camel Cuirassier | Desert +10% A; Forest/Jungle -20% D | Keeps the Cuirassier-era mounted-ranged rule while preserving the camel line's minor Desert specialization. |
| Dragoon | Forest/Jungle -20% D | Mounted-ranged mobility is less reliable while defending in dense features, without imposing a blanket attack penalty. |
| Gunship | Forest/Jungle -20% A | Dense cover reduces the effectiveness of air-mobile attack without adding an unnecessary defensive modifier. |
| Catapult / Trebuchet | Forest/Jungle -40% A/D | Early siege is deliberately very poor in dense features; 40% is reserved for this defining and highly situational feature weakness. |
| Ironclad | Coast +20% D | A focused coastal defensive niche fits the early armored warship and does not create land-city combat swings. |
| Worker / Settler / other noncombat civilians | None | Combat modifiers are intentionally omitted while these units have no combat strength; carrying dead values only adds XML/Sevopedia noise. |
| Cannon / Field Gun / Self-Propelled Artillery / Levitation Artillery | None | The severe rough-feature restriction is limited to early siege rather than automatically following every later artillery upgrade; later siege is balanced through its normal combat, collateral and mobility rules. |

### Civ-specific units

Only civ-specific units with a current terrain/feature/Hills effect are listed here. This table explains those effects only; the main [Civ-specific units rework](#civ-specific-units-rework) roster remains focused on each unit's actual replacement, timing and overall gameplay role.

| Unit | Current terrain/feature effects | Rationale / balance intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sumerian Vulture | Flood Plains +20% A, +10% D; Forest/Jungle +10% A/D | Sumeria gets one narrow Mesopotamian river-valley specialization instead of simultaneous strong Grass and Desert bonuses. The small Forest/Jungle effect is inherited from the axe-wielding generic Axeman. |
| Native American Dog Soldier | Plains +20% A, +10% D; Forest/Jungle +10% A/D | Great Plains warfare is the Dog Soldier's single terrain focus instead of broad Desert/Grass/Plains/Tundra coverage. The small Forest/Jungle effect is inherited from the axe-wielding generic Axeman. |
| Aztec Jaguar | Forest +10% A/D; Jungle +20% A, +40% D | Jungle fighting is the defining specialization; Forest remains only a minor related affinity. |
| Celtic Gallic Warrior | Plains +10% A/D; Forest +40% A/D | The Forest effect is intentionally the defining feature specialization, while Plains remains minor. |
| Roman Legionary | Plains +20% A, +10% D; Forest +10% A/D | Plains is the Legionary's single strong terrain specialization; the small Forest effect remains separate feature flavor, while the old extra Desert affinity is removed to avoid unnecessary breadth. |
| Persian Immortal | Desert/Grass +10% A/D | Keeps both Persian terrain affinities at the weak tier. Its spear/lance-like reach and shield make the same small defensive benefit as offensive benefit reasonable, while cheaper cost, resource flexibility and matchup bonuses remain its broader advantages. |
| Incan Quechua | Tundra +10% A/D; Hills +10% A/D | Uses a weak Tundra terrain affinity plus a separate minor Hills plot-type affinity for an Andean/high-altitude identity, without stacking strong bonuses on Peak movement and Sentry. |
| Japanese Samurai | Forest +20% A/D | Forest alone carries the terrain/feature identity; the minor Tundra bonus is removed so Combat II and the Samurai's other combat strengths are not accompanied by unrelated breadth. |
| Scandinavian Viking | Snow/Tundra +10% A/D | Uses two weak cold-terrain affinities for a clear northern identity; the Forest package is removed so the Viking does not specialize across too many environments. |
| Zulu Impi | Plains +20% A, +10% D; Hills +10% A/D; Forest/Jungle +10% A/D | Plains is the Impi's added UU specialization. The small Hills and rough-feature effects are the generic Spearman baseline, retained rather than stacking extra Grass/Desert specializations on top of the Impi's major 2-move perk. |
| Greek Hoplite | Plains +20% A, +10% D; Hills +10% A/D; Forest/Jungle +10% A/D | Plains formation fighting is the Hoplite's added UU specialization; Hills and rough-feature values remain at the generic Spearman baseline instead of also being boosted. |
| Mali Skirmisher | Plains/Desert +10% A/D; Hills +20% D | Plains and Desert become two weak Sahel/open-country affinities, while the normal Longbowman Hills defense is retained; the unrelated Jungle bonus is removed. |
| Babylonian Bowman | Desert +20% A, +10% D; Hills +20% D | Keeps the Longbowman's normal Hills defense and adds one focused Desert field specialization instead of maximum Grass and Desert bonuses on an already stronger 5-strength unit. |
| Chinese Zhuge Nu | Hills +20% A/D | Strengthens the generic Crossbowman's +10% Hills affinity to the strong UU tier and removes the old extra Grass/Forest maximum bonuses; collateral and other Crossbow strengths remain the main broader package. |
| Benin Disciplined Crossbowman | Hills +10% A/D; Jungle +20% A, +40% D | Keeps the generic Crossbowman's minor Hills affinity and makes Jungle the clear defining feature specialization; Plains and boosted Hills are removed, while Jungle defense remains the strongest situational effect. |
| English Yeoman Archer | Hills +10% A/D; Forest +20% A, +40% D | Keeps only the generic Crossbowman Hills baseline while Forest carries the defining Yeoman specialization; the previous boosted Hills tier was unnecessary on an already stronger and cheaper unit. |
| Ottoman Janissary | Plains/Desert +10% A/D | Uses two weak terrain affinities rather than one strong terrain. Its broader unit identity is elite, promotion-efficient infantry with a modest city-assault edge, so the terrain package remains deliberately minor. |
| French Musketeer | Plains/Tundra +10% A/D; Forest +20% A/D | Keeps a moderate mixed-terrain field identity without adding another broad raw-strength advantage. |
| Ethiopian Oromo Warrior | Hills +20% A, +10% D | Replaces the broad Plains/Grass/Desert package with one focused highland specialization, keeping terrain flavor while the extra base strength and First Strike remain universally useful advantages. |
| Irish Flying Column | Forest +20% A, +40% D; Hills +20% A | Strong defensive Forest specialization and hill attack support the guerrilla/ambush role without adding a Hills defense bonus. |
| USA Patriot | Forest +20% A/D | Forest becomes the single field-feature identity instead of broad Grass/Tundra/Desert/Forest adaptability; the cheaper Rifleman cost, First Strike and matchup effects already provide strong general value. |
| Egyptian War Chariot | Desert +20% A; Forest/Jungle -40% A, -20% D | Desert is the sole positive terrain specialization; the generic Chariot's severe dense-feature weakness remains, while the old extra Grass attack bonus is removed. |
| Carthaginian Numidian Cavalry | Plains +20% A; Forest/Jungle -20% D | Plains is the single positive open-country specialization; the old secondary Desert bonus is removed while the generic mounted-ranged rough-feature defensive weakness remains. |
| Khmer Ballista Elephant | Plains +10% A; Jungle +20% A; Forest -20% D | Retains the generic War Elephant's minor Plains affinity while Jungle is the UU-specific feature specialization; this avoids simultaneously upgrading both its broad terrain and narrow feature advantage. |
| Byzantine Cataphract | Grass +20% A; Forest/Jungle -20% A/D | Grass is the Cataphract's single strong positive terrain specialization; the extra Plains/Desert bonuses are removed while the heavy-mounted rough-feature weakness remains. |
| Mongol Khishigten | Plains +20% A; Forest/Jungle -20% A/D | Plains becomes the single strong steppe/open-ground attack specialization, replacing simultaneous maximum Desert/Grass bonuses; the generic heavy-mounted rough-feature weakness is restored on both Forest and Jungle. |
| Arabian Hajjan | Desert +20% A; Forest/Jungle -20% D | Upgrades the generic camel line's +10% Desert attack to the stronger UU tier while keeping rough-feature defense weak. |
| Spanish Conquistador | Plains +20% A, +10% D; Jungle -20% D | Plains remains the single strong positive terrain specialization; the extra Forest attack bonus is removed, while Jungle retains a mounted-ranged defensive weakness. |
| Russian Cossack | Tundra/Snow +10% A; Jungle -20% D | The former maximum Tundra/Snow attacks become two weak northern/frontier affinities and the extra Forest attack bonus is removed, leaving the Cossack's major matchup strengths to define its universal combat value. |
| German Hussar | Tundra +10% A; Forest +20% A; Jungle -20% D | Keeps the Hussar's terrain effects offensive and relatively narrow so its 3-move raiding role remains the main gameplay advantage. |
| Korean Hwacha | Grass +10% A; Forest +20% A | Generic Cannon has no terrain package; the Hwacha receives a limited civ-specific attack specialization without extra terrain defense. |
| Holy Roman Houfnice | Tundra/Plains +10% A; Forest +20% A | Like Hwacha, the Cannon replacement gets a modest attack-only specialty while generic later artillery remains terrain-neutral. |
| Portuguese Caçador | Grass +10% A/D; Forest +10% A/D | Uses two minor affinities rather than a strong terrain bonus: Grass supplies a weak general terrain identity while Forest gives a narrower light-infantry/skirmisher feature identity. Combat III, a chance first strike and slightly higher withdrawal remain the broader UU value. |

`FEATURE_FLOOD_PLAINS` can also use this system and provides another strategically distinct feature specialization; the Sumerian Vulture currently uses it for its Mesopotamian river-valley identity. Flood Plains are fertile river floodplains rather than a generic swamp and currently have normal feature movement, so any additional future use should be justified as floodplain/river-valley fighting rather than as movement through marshland.

## Civ-specific units rework

Done with the help of GPT-5.5 Thinking thanks. Since balance is prone to change, this section should be read as "as of now" documentation; see Sevopedia Unit for updated data.

General system context from the SAS docs: combat types are refined/split (archer subtypes, mounted melee/ranged, melee polearm/shock); weak/late civ-specific units are often replaced by earlier or more impactful ones; selected bonus requirements are relaxed for civ-specific variants while generic Swordsman/Cannon remain iron-only to preserve strategic pressure.

Legend: `str` = combat strength; `h` = hammer cost; `mv` = movement; `tech` = required tech(s); `bonus` = required bonus; `free` = free promotion(s); `mods` = selected modifier changes; `vsClass`/`vsCombat` = modifiers against a unit class/combat type.

Note: terrain/feature combat effects are a mostly new, currently optional cross-cutting AdvCiv-SAS system that also affects generic units. To keep this roster focused on each civ-specific unit's actual gameplay replacement and role, terrain/feature values and their shared reasoning are omitted here; see [Unit terrain and feature combat modifiers](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#unit-terrain-and-feature-combat-modifiers). Exact current values remain visible in XML and Sevopedia Unit.

Note 2: paired columns are visually merged below (`Before → current SAS`, with both comparison summaries kept in the same linear `Changes` cell) to keep the roster substantially narrower. It can still be [viewed on CFC](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/advciv-sas-simple-advanced-strategy.699716/post-16954876) if useful (refer to GitHub or XML/Sevopedia if that copy is not updated).

As of now, playable civilizations intentionally have no naval civ-specific units. Naval replacements can be effectively absent on land-heavy maps and disproportionately important on naval-heavy maps, especially when most other civilizations have no comparable naval replacement; balancing them fairly would otherwise tend to require a broader set of naval counterparts. The Netherlands and Portugal are current examples of this policy: the East Indiaman was replaced by the Swift Worker and the Carrack by the Caçador. Naval warfare itself remains unchanged by this rule; it only keeps civ-specific unit power more consistently relevant across map types.

| Civ | Before → current SAS | Changes | Summary / rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| America / USA | AMERICAN_NAVY_SEAL (MARINE; GUN) → **USA_PATRIOT** (**RIFLEMAN**; Keep) | Old → SAS: str 24→15, h 160→100; tech INDUSTRIALISM, RIFLING→MILITARY_TRADITION, FIREARMS; free AMPHIBIOUS->none, MARCH→FIRST_STRIKE1; loses FirstStrikeChance 1, FirstStrikes 1, vsClass ARTILLERY 50, vsClass MACHINE_GUN 50; vs SAS RIFLEMAN: h 120→100; free none→FIRST_STRIKE1 | Earlier Patriot/Rifleman timing is more useful than a late Marine-only UU. Significant cost reduction better represents "No Taxation without Representation" and makes it a more unique perk of it costing same price as previous unit; indirectly buffs upgrades too that are now cheaper as well. Real UU effect without making each individual Patriot unrealistically stronger. |
| Arabia | ARABIA_CAMELARCHER (KNIGHT; MOUNTED) → **ARABIA_HAJJAN** (**CAMEL_KNIGHT**; **MOUNTED_RANGED**) | Old → SAS: h 90→95; tech GUILDS, HORSEBACK_RIDING, ARCHERY→CHIVALRY, MOUNTED_COMBAT; bonus none→CAMEL, IRON; free none→FIRST_STRIKE1; mods Withdraw 15→20; vs SAS CAMEL_KNIGHT: free none→FIRST_STRIKE1; mods Withdraw 10→20 | Mounted-ranged camel knight: stronger vs Pikemen and broader polearm counters than melee knights; resists gun/modern units better than melee-mounted units do (same logic as Cuirassiers/Dragoons); retreat supports skirmishing. |
| Aztec | AZTEC_JAGUAR (SWORDSMAN; MELEE) → Keep (**AXEMAN**; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: tech IRON_WORKING→BRONZE_WORKING; free WOODSMAN1→COMBAT1; loses CityAtk 10; vs SAS AXEMAN: res COPPER, IRON→none; free none→COMBAT1 | Jaguar moves to earlier Axeman role and keeps base no-bonus; the jaguars are elite forces valued in society, so give an early enough, cheap enough, and widespread enough promotion, that this early unit may not be OP having (may have already have it) so maybe not OP while still being quite strong to have; old Jaguar was weak/late and worse than normal Swordsman in practice; supports early aggressive Aztec profile and Sacrificial Altar/slavery economy. Having a stronger unit is also a better thematic fit for a strong/threatening ancient/early civlization. |
| Babylon | BABYLON_BOWMAN (ARCHER; ARCHER) → Keep (**LONGBOWMAN**; **ARCHER_BOW_SHORT**) | Old → SAS: str 3→5, h 25→40; tech ARCHERY→CONSTRUCTION, HUNTING; free none→RETREAT1; mods CityDef 50→10; gains FirstStrikeChance 1; loses vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS LONGBOWMAN: str 4→5; mods CityDef 25→10 | Bowman moves to the Construction Longbow slot; more versatile than an ancient city garrison and can support offensive Babylon pushes. |
| Byzantium | BYZANTINE_CATAPHRACT (KNIGHT; MOUNTED) → Keep (**HORSE_KNIGHT**; **MOUNTED_MELEE**) | Old → SAS: h 90→105; tech GUILDS, HORSEBACK_RIDING→CHIVALRY, MOUNTED_COMBAT; vs SAS HORSE_KNIGHT: str 10→12, h 95→105 | Slight nerf through cost increase as Cataphract was a bit too strong; it remains a high-strength Horse Knight replacement without needing another large general-purpose power increase. |
| Carthage | CARTHAGE_NUMIDIAN_CAVALRY (HORSE_ARCHER; MOUNTED) → Keep (Keep; **MOUNTED_MELEE**) | Old → SAS: str 5→6; tech HORSEBACK_RIDING, ARCHERY→MOUNTED_COMBAT, HUNTING; free FLANKING1→RETREAT1; mods Withdraw 20→15; loses vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS HORSE_ARCHER: free none→RETREAT1; mods Withdraw 20→15 | Raises Numidian to Horse Archer-level strength and shifts from narrow anti-melee gimmick to more general mobile skirmisher/withdraw unit. |
| Celts | CELTIC_GALLIC_WARRIOR (SWORDSMAN; MELEE) → Keep (Keep; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: h 40→42; free GUERILLA1→FIRST_STRIKE1; vs SAS SWORDSMAN: res IRON→COPPER, IRON; free none→FIRST_STRIKE1 | Guerilla hill-defense was too situational and a bad match for Brennus/Boudica aggressive profile; first-strike sword role is more generally useful; copper/iron access improves flexibility. |
| China | CHINA_CHOKONU (CROSSBOWMAN; ARCHER) → **CHINA_ZHUGE_NU** (Keep; **ARCHER_CROSSBOW**) | Old → SAS: h 60→65; tech MACHINERY, ARCHERY→ENGINEERING; bonus IRON→COPPER, IRON; free none→COLLATERAL_DAMAGE1; mods Collateral 50→15, FirstStrikes 2→1, FirstStrikeChance 0→1; loses vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS CROSSBOWMAN: res IRON→COPPER, IRON; free none→COLLATERAL_DAMAGE1; mods Collateral 0→15, CollateralMaxUnits 3→5, FirstStrikeChance 0→1 | Lower and less deterministic collateral/first-strike burst than the old Cho-Ko-Nu. Mixed first strikes and collateral remain useful against different targets (in particular firstStrike-immune ones), while free Collateral I can persist through upgrades. |
| Netherlands | NETHERLANDS_OOSTINDIEVAARDER (FRIGATE; NAVAL) → **NETHERLANDS_SWIFT_WORKER** (**WORKER**; **NONE**) | Replaced the old Frigate UU (str 8, h 90, mv 5; CHEMISTRY + ASTRONOMY; Bombard 12, Cargo 3) with a new Worker UU (str 0, h 60, mv 3; no tech prerequisite; WorkRate 100); vs SAS WORKER: mv 2→3 | Late naval UU was too weak/situational; early Worker is useful on every map, better fits Dutch economy/growth, restores old BTS Fast Worker effect, and gives India real worker-UU company. And unlike India, the fairly late and situational Dutch civ-specific building counterbalances this civ-specific unit being quite strong. |
| Egypt | EGYPT_WARCHARIOT (CHARIOT; MOUNTED) → **EGYPTIAN_WAR_CHARIOT** (Keep; **MOUNTED_MELEE**) | Old → SAS: mods vsClass AXEMAN 100→75; vs SAS CHARIOT: str 4→5 | Keeps the War Chariot as a stronger early Chariot while reducing the old extreme anti-Axeman spike from +100% to +75%, preserving a threatening early unit without making its favored matchup too deterministic. |
| England | ENGLISH_REDCOAT (RIFLEMAN; GUN) → **ENGLISH_YEOMAN_ARCHER** (**CROSSBOWMAN**; **ARCHER_BOW_LONG**) | Old → SAS: str 14→7, h 110→60; tech RIFLING→ENGINEERING; mods Withdraw 0→25; gains FirstStrikes 1, vsCombat MELEE_SHOCK 30; loses vsCombat GUN 25, vsCombat MOUNTED 25; vs SAS CROSSBOWMAN: str 6→7, h 65→60; bonus IRON→none; mods vsCombat MELEE_SHOCK 50→30 | Moves England's civ-specific unit from late Rifleman timing to the Crossbowman slot. No Iron requirement, higher base strength and lower cost make the Yeoman more versatile than the generic Crossbowman and more relevant to England's earlier military window, while still fitting a defensive/economic civ profile. |
| Ethiopia | ETHIOPIAN_OROMO_WARRIOR (MUSKETMAN; GUN) → Keep | Old → SAS: str 9→13, h 80→100; tech GUNPOWDER→FIREARMS; free DRILL1, DRILL2→FIRST_STRIKE1; FirstStrikes 1->0; vs SAS MUSKETMAN: str 12→13, free none→FIRST_STRIKE1 | An overall stronger unit than the SAS musketman and the base musketman, rather than being overly first-strike specialized (keep the promotion rather than iFirstStrikes so later units can inherit it). |
| France | FRENCH_MUSKETEER (MUSKETMAN; GUN) → Keep | Old → SAS: str 9→12, h 80→100, mv 2→1; tech GUNPOWDER→FIREARMS; free none→COUNTER_MOUNTED; vs SAS MUSKETMAN: free none→COUNTER_MOUNTED | Buffs weak move-speed-only effect: movement helps positioning, not combat; anti-mounted gives actual fighting value against strong Renaissance/Industrial mounted units. |
| Germany | GERMAN_PANZER (TANK; ARMOR) → **GERMAN_HUSSAR** (**DRAGOON**; **MOUNTED_RANGED**) | Old → SAS: str 28→16, h 180→140, mv 2→3; tech INDUSTRIALISM, RIFLING→MILITARY_TRADITION, FIREARMS, MOUNTED_COMBAT; bonus OIL→HORSE; free BLITZ→RETREAT1; loses FirstStrikes 2, vsCombat ARMOR 50; vs SAS DRAGOON: h 150→140, mv 2→3; free none→RETREAT1 | Earlier than usually-too-late Panzer; 3 movement gives the Hussar a clearer light-cavalry role as a fast raider, scout, pursuit unit, and artillery hunter rather than just a slightly cheaper Dragoon. This also brings back some of the fast Cavalry 3 Move Speed flavor from Civ3, which may be a good fit here and perhaps enjoyable too. Slightly lower-than-Dragoon cost as an alternative effect and for thematic fit. Later UU timing counterbalances Germany's strong early essential UB without making the unit a raw-strength upgrade. |
| Greece | GREEK_PHALANX (AXEMAN; MELEE) → **GREEK_HOPLITE** (**SPEARMAN**; **MELEE_POLEARM**) | Old → SAS: gains CityDef 10; loses defVsClass CHARIOT 100, vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS SPEARMAN: mods vsCombat MELEE_SHOCK 10→25; gains CityDef 10 | Spear/polearm Hoplite is more accurate; SAS Spearman buff makes it better outside cities too, especially vs melee, while still guarding stacks against horse/camel archers and War Elephants. |
| Holy Rome | HOLY_ROMAN_LANDSKNECHT (PIKEMAN; MELEE) → **HOLY_ROMAN_HOUFNICE** (**CANNON**; **SIEGE**) | Old → SAS: str 6→13, h 60→130; tech ENGINEERING→CHEMISTRY, MACHINERY; bonus IRON→COPPER, IRON; gains Bombard 12, Collateral 100, CollateralLimit 200, CollateralMaxUnits 6; loses vsCombat MELEE 100, vsCombat MOUNTED 100; vs SAS CANNON: h 140→130; bonus IRON→COPPER, IRON | Old Landsknecht was a weak late defensive melee unit near guns; the cheaper Houfnice gives Charlemagne mobile offensive siege that stays useful into the Renaissance. City Bombard Damage remains selectable with experience rather than automatic, requiring a tradeoff against City Raider or other siege promotions. |
| Inca | INCAN_QUECHUA (WARRIOR; MELEE) → Keep (**SWORDSMAN**; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: str 2→6, h 15→42; tech none→IRON_WORKING; bonus none→COPPER, IRON; bCanMoveImpassable 0->1; free COMBAT1→SENTRY; gains CityAtk 10; loses CityDef 25; vs SAS SWORDSMAN: res IRON→COPPER, IRON; bCanMoveImpassable 0->1; free none→SENTRY | AdvCiv Quechua was too weak and obsolete too quickly in the very early Warrior slot; later Swordsman-slot Quechua fits Inca's builder/economy profile and later historical identity better. Peak walking and Sentry-style scouting add gameplay variety at a stage where the extra mobility/vision is less likely to dominate the opening game. |
| India | INDIAN_FAST_WORKER (WORKER; NONE) → Keep | — | — |
| Japan | JAPAN_SAMURAI (MACEMAN; MELEE) → Keep (Keep; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: h 70→65; tech CIVIL_SERVICE, MACHINERY→CIVIL_SERVICE, IRON_WORKING; bonus IRON→COPPER, IRON; free DRILL1→COMBAT2; gains FirstStrikeChance 1; loses FirstStrikes 2, vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS MACEMAN: free none→COMBAT2; mods vsCombat MELEE_SHOCK 25→50; gains FirstStrikeChance 1 | At this stage most units may already have COMBAT1 which is fairly ubiquitous, or we may inherit it from one of our upgraded units, or annoyingly purposely avoid to do so for human players: would make it too weak/useless; give a stronger one instead |
| Khmer | KHMER_BALLISTA_ELEPHANT (WAR_ELEPHANT; MOUNTED) → Keep (Keep; **MOUNTED_RANGED**) | Old → SAS: tech CONSTRUCTION, HORSEBACK_RIDING→MOUNTED_COMBAT, ANIMAL_HUSBANDRY; bonus IVORY→ELEPHANTS; loses vsCombat MOUNTED 50; vs SAS WAR_ELEPHANT: mods; gains FirstStrikes 1 | Ranged War Elephant gives different matchups than base melee War Elephant, especially vs Spearman/Pikeman and broader polearm counters. |
| Korea | KOREAN_HWACHA (CATAPULT; SIEGE) → Keep (**CANNON**; Keep) | Old → SAS: str 5→13, h 50→140; tech CONSTRUCTION→CHEMISTRY, MACHINERY; free none→COLLATERAL_DAMAGE1; mods Bombard 8→12, CollateralLimit 50→200, CollateralMaxUnits 6→7; loses vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS CANNON: res IRON→none; free none→COLLATERAL_DAMAGE1; mods CollateralMaxUnits 6→7 | Catapult/Trebuchet window is short; Cannon-slot Hwacha stays useful much longer and better fits Korean gunpowder/fire-arrow technology. |
| Mali | MALI_SKIRMISHER (ARCHER; ARCHER) → Keep (**LONGBOWMAN**; **ARCHER_BOW_SHORT**) | Old → SAS: str 4→5, h 25→45; tech ARCHERY→CONSTRUCTION, HUNTING; free none→FIRST_STRIKE1; mods CityDef 50→10; gains FirstStrikes 1; vs SAS LONGBOWMAN: str 4→5; free RETREAT1→FIRST_STRIKE1; mods CityDef 25→10, Withdraw 25→50 | Skirmisher becomes an active field defender/harasser instead of an early city garrison. |
| Maya | MAYA_HOLKAN (SPEARMAN; MELEE) → **MAYA_QUICK_WORKER** (**WORKER**; **NONE**) | Replace the military UU with a civilian Worker UU; vs SAS WORKER: WorkRate 100→125; cost 60 and movement 2 unchanged | Pacal/Maya have often underperformed or lost early in autoplay. The very weak base Civ4/AdvCiv Holkan, and the later SAS attempt to make it a more useful Spearman/skirmisher, still leave Maya with a narrow early military role and short usefulness window; the culture-oriented Ball Court is also relatively specialized rather than a broad compensating power spike. Moving the UU to an otherwise unused work-rate Worker role is therefore primarily an attempt to strengthen Maya more generally rather than force one military niche. The +25% work rate is compatible with Pacal's usual peaceful development but remains strategically open-ended: faster resources, roads, improvements and chops can support military logistics, expansion, economy or wonder building, making his Financial/Industrious profile more versatile. The theme also fits well: Maya agriculture and infrastructure relied on sustained landscape management and organized labor, while the design remains distinct from India's terrain-cost immunity and the Dutch Swift Worker's extra movement. It additionally gives a loose Civilization-series callback to Civ3's worker-oriented Maya, where the Agricultural/Industrious civilization could generate Workers from Javelin Thrower victories through Enslave. |
| Mongolia | MONGOL_KESHIK (HORSE_ARCHER; MOUNTED) → **MONGOL_KHISHIGTEN** (**HORSE_KNIGHT**; **MOUNTED_MELEE**) | Old → SAS: str 6→10, h 50→105; tech HORSEBACK_RIDING, ARCHERY→CHIVALRY, MOUNTED_COMBAT; bonus HORSE→HORSE, IRON; free none→BLITZKRIEG, RETREAT1; mods Withdraw 20→15; loses FirstStrikes 1, vsClass CATAPULT 50; vs SAS HORSE_KNIGHT: h 95→105; free none→BLITZKRIEG, RETREAT1; mods Withdraw 10→15; Ignores Terrain Movement Costs | Keshik window was too short before Knights; Horse Knight slot gives Mongolia a longer medieval cavalry window toward its historical peak. Free terrain movement, retreat, and Blitz emphasize tactical control over Cataphract-style raw strength. |
| Native America | NATIVE_AMERICA_DOG_SOLDIER (AXEMAN; MELEE) → Keep (Keep; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: str 4→5; free none→FIRST_STRIKE1; loses vsCombat MELEE 100; vs SAS AXEMAN: res COPPER, IRON→none; free none→FIRST_STRIKE1 | No-metal anti-sword pressure without locking Dog Soldier into pure defense. |
| Ottomans | OTTOMAN_JANISSARY (MUSKETMAN; GUN) → Keep | Old → SAS: str 9→12, h 80→100; tech GUNPOWDER→FIREARMS; free none→COMBAT3; gains CityAtk 10; loses vsCombat ARCHER 25, vsCombat MELEE 25, vsCombat MOUNTED 25; vs SAS MUSKETMAN: free none→COMBAT3; gains CityAtk 10 | Keeps the Janissary as a strong Ottoman Musketman power spike through elite training rather than raw base strength. Free Combat III is less likely than a low Combat promotion to be redundant on experienced upgraded units and modestly accelerates later Combat ranks, while +10% city attack gives an Ottoman assault lean without making the unit a dedicated city attacker. Its small Plains/Desert affinities remain the separate terrain identity. |
| Persia | PERSIA_IMMORTAL (CHARIOT; MOUNTED) → Keep (**SWORDSMAN**; **MELEE_POLEARM**) | Old → SAS: str 4→6, h 30→38, mv 2→1; tech THE_WHEEL→IRON_WORKING; bonus HORSE→COPPER, IRON; gains CityAtk 10; loses Withdraw 10, vsClass AXEMAN 100, vsCombat ARCHER 25; vs SAS SWORDSMAN: h 42→38; bonus IRON→COPPER, IRON | Closer to Civ3 sword-based Immortal: Chariot anti-archer rush→later Swordsman/Polearm fighter with bonuses vs melee-shock and mounted-melee; copper/iron access improves buildability. |
| Portugal | PORTUGAL_CARRACK (CARAVEL; NAVAL) → **PORTUGAL_CACADOR** (**GRENADIER**; **GUN**) | Old → SAS: replace the naval Carrack with a land Grenadier UU; vs SAS GRENADIER: free none→COMBAT3; mods Withdraw 20→25, FirstStrikeChance 0→1; gains Grass +10% A/D, Forest +10% A/D | Replaces a strongly map-dependent naval UU with a versatile later land unit. Combat III gives the Caçador a useful elite-training perk that is unlikely to be redundant on veteran upgrades and can remain useful after upgrading again; the chance first strike and small withdrawal increase support a light-infantry/skirmisher role, while the two minor terrain/feature affinities add battlefield identity without dominating combat. Coincidentally, both start with "ca" which is funny (and both units started with a "G" (Galleon in AdvCiv-SAS before removal) but anyway). |
| Rome | ROME_PRAETORIAN (SWORDSMAN; MELEE) → **ROMAN_LEGIONARY** (Keep; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: str 7→6, h 40→42; bonus IRON→COPPER, IRON; free MARCH→COMBAT2; gains CityAtk 10; vs SAS SWORDSMAN: res IRON→COPPER, IRON; free none→COMBAT2 | Strength reduced because Praetorian was too strong; broader buildability through copper/iron access; weak March healing swapped for Combat to support Roman classical aggression/solid expansion. COMBAT2 rather than COMBAT1: same reasoning as as of now the Samurai. |
| Russia | RUSSIA_COSSACK (CAVALRY; MOUNTED) → Keep (**DRAGOON**; **MOUNTED_RANGED**) | Old → SAS: str 15→16, h 120→150; tech MILITARY_TRADITION, RIFLING, HORSEBACK_RIDING→MILITARY_TRADITION, FIREARMS, MOUNTED_COMBAT; loses vsCombat MOUNTED 50 | Moves the Cossack from the old Cavalry slot to the new Dragoon slot, giving Russia its distinctive mobile gunpowder cavalry in the intended midgame mounted-ranged window instead of relying on the old broad +50% anti-mounted Cavalry bonus. |
| Spain | SPANISH_CONQUISTADOR (CUIRASSIER; MOUNTED) → Keep (**HORSE_CUIRASSIER**; **MOUNTED_RANGED**) | Old → SAS: str 12→13, h 100→130; tech MILITARY_TRADITION, GUNPOWDER, HORSEBACK_RIDING→FIREARMS, MOUNTED_COMBAT; free none→AMPHIBIOUS; mods Withdraw 15→30; loses vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS HORSE_CUIRASSIER: free none→AMPHIBIOUS; mods Withdraw 15→30 | Reworks the Conquistador from the old broad +50% anti-melee counter into a more flexible expeditionary Cuirassier: Amphibious enables coastal/cross-river assaults and doubled withdrawal improves mobile offensive use without hard-countering an entire combat family. |
| Sumeria | SUMERIAN_VULTURE (AXEMAN; MELEE) → Keep (Keep; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: str 6→5; loses vsCombat MELEE 25; vs SAS AXEMAN: mods vsCombat MELEE_SHOCK 25→50 | — |
| Vikings / Scandinavia | VIKING_BESERKER (MACEMAN; MELEE) → **SCANDINAVIA_VIKING** (Keep; **MELEE_SHOCK**) | Old → SAS: h 70→65; tech CIVIL_SERVICE, MACHINERY→CIVIL_SERVICE, IRON_WORKING; mods CityAtk 10→20; loses vsCombat MELEE 50; vs SAS MACEMAN: free none→AMPHIBIOUS; gains CityAtk 20 | Replaces awkward Berserker framing with iconic Viking raider role; stronger amphibious Maceman matters more before Knights/Crossbows make standard Macemen feel weak, matching the historical Viking era better. |
| Zulu | ZULU_IMPI (SPEARMAN; MELEE) → Keep (Keep; **MELEE_POLEARM**) | Old → SAS: str 4→5; tech HUNTING→BRONZE_WORKING; free MOBILITY→none; loses vsCombat MOUNTED 100; vs SAS SPEARMAN: mv 1→2; mods vsCombat MELEE_SHOCK 10→25 | SAS Spearman buffs and stronger melee-shock focus make Impi a stronger field fighter; keeps fast 2-move pressure for Shaka/Zulu aggression; still counters mounted units. |
| Kingdom of Benin | — → New **KINGDOM_OF_BENIN_DISCIPLINED_CROSSBOWMAN** (**CROSSBOWMAN**; **ARCHER_CROSSBOW**) | Old → SAS: new SAS UU; str 6; h 65; mv 1; tech ENGINEERING; bonus COPPER, IRON; free LOGISTICS; mods Withdraw 35, FirstStrikes 1; vs SAS CROSSBOWMAN: res IRON→COPPER, IRON; free none→LOGISTICS; mods Withdraw 25→35 | Broader buildability through Copper/Iron access; Logistics promotion suits Benin organized warfare/siege-logistics theme; field kit supports fighting outside static defense. |
| Ireland | — → New **IRELAND_FLYING_COLUMN** (**RIFLEMAN**; **GUN**) | Old → SAS: new SAS UU; str 15; h 120; mv 1; tech MILITARY_TRADITION, FIREARMS; bCanMoveImpassable 0->1; free LOGISTICS; mods vsCombat MOUNTED_MELEE 50, vsCombat MOUNTED_RANGED 25; vs SAS RIFLEMAN: bCanMoveImpassable 0->1; free none→LOGISTICS | Ireland is late historically, so Rifleman timing avoids an even-later Infantry UU. Logistics and Peak walking support a mobile guerrilla/independence-war role while keeping the unit relevant. |

## Leaders' traits rework

While doing/considering the holy roman empire civ-specific unit's rework or replacement, i have noticed charlemagne's traits were not in accord with his historical profile (i asked chatgpt 5 thanks since i don't know too much if at all about his history and leader profile or such and to be sure and have its advice as well thanks).

It is also limiting when we want as now to assign a new unit e.g. to the holy roman empire or possibly building, so i thought this was a good time to rework leader traits for balance, accuracy, and overall synergy with the civ's profile, as well as its civ-specific units and buildings, and also to match ingame behaviour +/- more(/most?) importantly xml or and such if / as much as possible or relevant i mean.

Done with the help of chatgpt 5 thanks a lot and thanks to my prompts too or adjustments or thoughts or formatting or such, check if accurate. Also, since then, reviewed and adjusted with the help of several other LLMs.

Note: asking GPT-5.5-Thinking (i.e. ChatGPT) in a temporary chat additionally to the usual history-aware chat gives/yields surprisingly good results.

### previous state

This is extracted from the [CIV4LeaderHeadInfos.xml](/Assets/XML/Civilizations/CIV4LeaderHeadInfos.xml) rather, as we had issues importing it from our custom leaders_data_to_ or it took too much time, due to data being too big or i guess maybe if i'm not mistaken.

### new state after rework with rationale or such

#### main table after changes to traits

| Leader | Current Traits | Recommendation | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alexander | Philosophical, Aggressive | **Keep** | Philosopher-king + relentless conqueror fits. |
| Asoka | Spiritual, Organized | **Spiritual, Protective** | Edicts focused on welfare/stability: medical care for people & animals, wells/trees, non-violence. Reads as "guardian of the realm's well-being." |
| Augustus | Imperialist, Industrious | **Keep** | Empire builder + massive works program. |
| Bismarck | Expansive, Industrious | **Organized, Protective** | Why not Aggressive? He orchestrated three short, limited wars (1864, 1866, 1870-71) to unify Germany, then spent the rest of his career preventing great-power war via alliance webs (Dreikaiserbund, Reinsurance Treaty, Congress of Berlin). That's sharp power politics, not a "wade-in-and-smash" military persona. He wasn't a battlefield leader; his hallmark is calculated diplomacy + internal statecraft. What really defines him? Organized: high-efficiency governance-central civil service, Reichsbank, tariffs, and the pioneering social insurance system (health 1883, accident 1884, old-age 1889). This maps perfectly to your "-75% upkeep" / efficient state. Protective (in your mod's sense = stability/no anarchy/health): post-1871 his entire strategy was systemic risk management (deterrence, balance) and domestically "order first" (Anti-Socialist Laws) plus worker protection through insurance-i.e., protecting the state's cohesion and people's welfare. Verdict (accuracy-first): Go Organized + Protective. It captures both the manager-state architect and the stability/health side far better than Aggressive. (Charismatic doesn't fit his public vibe, and Imperialistic doesn't match his reluctant, late, and limited colonial stance.) |
| Boudica | Charismatic, Aggressive | **Keep** | War leader rallying tribes; morale + offense. |
| Brennus | Spiritual, Charismatic | **Keep** | Druidic authority + chieftain charisma. |
| Catherine | Creative, Imperialist | **Philosophical, Imperialist** | Enlightened despot: corresponded with Voltaire/Diderot, issued the Nakaz, pushed legal/educational reform-more thinker-ruler than pure arts patron. Philosophical = ideas shaping policy. Catherine is the poster child for Enlightened absolutism: the Nakaz (Instruction), legal/education reforms, heavy engagement with Voltaire/Diderot, commissions on law and schooling. Her brand is "rules by ideas.". Creative = culture output/patronage. She absolutely patronized the arts (Hermitage, theatre), but that was a means to an ideological/modernizing end, not her core identity. If you want to signal culture yields in gameplay, Creative is fine; historically, it's secondary to her policymaking. |
| Charlemagne | Imperialist, Protective | **Imperialist, Organized** | For Charlemagne — Charles the Great, king of the Franks and later crowned emperor in 800 — I’d describe him as ambitious, energetic, commanding, religious, reform-minded, and often ruthless. He was not just a ceremonial ruler. He spent much of his reign campaigning, especially against the Saxons, whose conquest took more than 30 years, and he built a huge Frankish empire by force. At the same time, he cared a lot about administration, law, education, the church, and royal control; Britannica describes him as focused on making inherited political institutions more effective. So, in plain terms, Charlemagne’s personality was something like: warrior-king, empire-builder, Christian reformer, strict ruler, and organizer of a huge realm. He could be visionary and culturally important, but also brutal, especially in the forced Christianization of conquered peoples. Imperialistic: excellent fit; probably the best trait for him. He expanded Frankish power enormously through conquest, creating one of the largest Western European empires since Rome. Organized: excellent alternate; he cared about administration, law, education, church reform, royal agents, and governing a large empire. Historically, this may fit better than Protective. |
| Churchill | Charismatic, Protective | **Keep** | Wartime morale + defensive strategy. |
| Cyrus | Charismatic, Imperialist | **Keep** | Founder of vast empire; tolerant unifier. |
| Darius | Organized, Financial | **Keep** | Satrapies/roads/taxation; efficient and wealthy. |
| De Gaulle | Industrious, Charismatic | **Charismatic, Organized** | Resistance icon and founder of the Fifth Republic's institutions. Post-war modernization happened, but his identity is leadership + constitutional/administrative redesign more than building programs. |
| Elizabeth | Philosophical, Financial | **Creative, Financial** | Her era is literally shorthand for a cultural bloom: Shakespeare/Marlowe, theatres, court masques, music, letters. She wasn't a "philosopher-queen" so much as a savvy ruler who presided over (and patronized) an artistic boom. Keeping Financial also tracks (privateering, merchant ventures, early global trade). `<!-- custom: plus her being creative gives a very varied English civ with our current English leader other pairs -->` |
| Ewuare | Imperialist, Spiritual | **Spiritual, Industrious** | Benin's strong court/ritual religion. Benin's strength = urban works (walls/ditches), craft guilds, and court art; expansion via hegemony/tribute more than settler-style growth. Industrious captures that better than Imperialist. |
| Frederick | Philosophical, Organized | **Philosophical, Creative** | Enlightenment/arts over bureaucracy. |
| Gandhi | Spiritual, Philosophical | **Keep** | Canonical fit. |
| Grace O'Malley | Financial, Aggressive | **Keep** | Maritime raider profile and commerce fit; keep as-is. |
| Genghis Khan | Aggressive, Imperialist | **Keep** | Archetypal conqueror. |
| Gilgamesh | Protective, Creative | **Keep** | Walls/city defense + epic/civic culture. |
| Hammurabi | Organized, Aggressive | **Keep** | Hammurabi seems to have been disciplined, pragmatic, ambitious, legalistic, and highly concerned with royal authority. We do not know his “personality” in a modern psychological sense, because most surviving evidence is royal, administrative, or legal, but his actions suggest a ruler who wanted to impose order on a complicated kingdom. He ruled Babylon roughly 1792–1750 BCE, expanded it from a smaller city-state into a major territorial kingdom, and conquered much of southern Babylonia. He is most famous for the Code of Hammurabi, a large collection of legal decisions covering trade, family law, crime, slavery, debt, and civil disputes. So, in plain terms, I would describe him as: orderly, authoritarian, calculating, justice-focused, pious, and strategically aggressive. Not “nice,” exactly. His law code could be harsh, and punishments depended heavily on social class. But he clearly wanted to present himself as a king of law, stability, punishment, and social order. Organized: perfect fit; this is the best trait for him. Hammurabi is remembered above all as a lawgiver and administrator. The Code of Hammurabi, royal building projects, canals, temples, walls, and central authority all fit “Organized.” Aggressive: Good fit; he was not just a lawgiver; he was also a conqueror. Babylon became a major Mesopotamian power under him through military expansion. `<!-- custom: as of now, the Bowman (civ-specific Babylonian unit) does not synergize with the Aggressive trait, but this allows Babylon to stay relevant as a military/aggressive playstyle civ well into later eras (knights, alternative swordsmen play, guns, etc.). Plus, as of now the bowman is very strong so seems balanced as such. -->` |
| Hannibal | Financial, Charismatic | **Keep** | Hallmark = operational genius + multi-ethnic army cohesion and Italian defections after Cannae. More "inspire & outmaneuver" than brute-force brutality. Charismatic still supports a war playstyle (cheaper promos) without the raw smash of Aggressive; Financial keeps Carthaginian commerce. |
| Hatshepsut | Spiritual, Creative | **Spiritual, Financial** | Iconic Punt expedition + trade-focused reign; commerce funded temples/works. Her identity reads more "trade & temple economy" than "arts output." `<!-- custom: also will most likely buff her if i'm not mistaken, which is nice i think -->` |
| Huayna Capac | Industrious, Financial | **Industrious, Organized** | Inca economy was state-planned and labor-tax (mit'a), not money/market-driven. "Organized" fits roads, storehouses, and redistribution much better than "Financial." |
| Isabella | Spiritual, Expansive | **Spiritual, Imperialistic** | Isabella seems to have been deeply religious, disciplined, politically clever, personally austere, determined, and very hard-edged. She was not just a passive queen beside Ferdinand; she made major decisions, defended her claim in a succession war, took an active interest in the Granada campaign, and backed Columbus. She also had a strong sense of order and moral certainty. That could look like justice, seriousness, and administrative discipline to supporters, but also like rigidity, intolerance, and ruthlessness by modern standards, especially because of the Inquisition and the expulsion/conversion policies. Spiritual: Perfect fit; religion was central to her rule: “the Catholic” title, church strengthening, the Inquisition, the Granada crusading spirit, and religious unity as state policy. Imperialistic: very strong fit; She helped finish the Reconquista, supported overseas expansion through Columbus, and her reign began Spain’s New World empire. |
| Joao | Imperialist, Expansive | **Imperialist, Financial** | Maritime commerce + colonial charters; cleaner than Expansive overlap. |
| Julius Caesar | Organized, Imperialist | **Aggressive, Imperialist** | Primary identity = conqueror (Gaul, Civil War). Keep Imperialist for expansion; swap in Aggressive to reflect operational boldness. `<!-- custom: plus matches with xml profile of aggression and thematic epicness -->` |
| Justinian | Spiritual, Imperialist | **Philosophical, Industrious** | Big reconquests (Africa, Italy, S. Hispania) + colossal building + Corpus Juris Civilis are uncontested. Critics say the reconquest wars/taxation left the state overextended and then the Justinianic Plague hit hard; newer work debates how devastating the plague really was. Net: "restorer & codifier," but also "overstretched the empire.". Less "Spiritual," more "Legal/Scholar + Empire-builder.". Reconquests != colonization. His lasting mark is legal/intellectual codification + mega building (Hagia Sophia, fortifications), not founding/settler-driven growth. |
| Kublai Khan | Aggressive, Creative | **Keep** | For Kublai Khan, I’d describe his personality as: ambitious, pragmatic, cultured, commanding, imperial, administratively minded, and less purely destructive than Genghis Khan. Kublai was Genghis Khan’s grandson, became Great Khan in 1260, founded the Yuan dynasty, and completed the Mongol conquest of China in 1279. That made him the first Yuan ruler of all China. The big difference between Genghis and Kublai is that Genghis feels like the archetypal steppe conqueror, while Kublai feels more like a conqueror-emperor. He still used Mongol military power, but he also adopted Chinese-style administration, moved the capital to Dadu/Beijing, used centralized bureaucracy, supported roads, postal stations, canal repair, trade, and cultural life. So in plain terms: Kublai was a Mongol conqueror who wanted to rule like a Chinese emperor. Aggressive: Strong fit; He was still a Mongol war leader and completed the conquest of China. It fits, though not as perfectly as it does for Genghis. Creative: Surprisingly strong fit; This captures his courtly, cultural, capital-building side: Yuan China had major cultural development, foreign exchange, roads, postal systems, and a new imperial capital. `<!-- custom: plus from a gameplay stance not sharing imperialistic with genghis khan allows to have a more varied mongol civ (although both are as of now still aggressive, seems thematically and strategicall more varied as such for this civ, and reduces imperialistic overall footprint among all civs). -->` |
| Lincoln | Philosophical, Charismatic | **Keep** | Moral/philosophical leadership + national unity. |
| Louis XIV | Industrious, Creative | **Keep** | Palace/works + arts and culture. |
| Mansa Musa | Spiritual, Financial | **Keep** | Pilgrimage/religion + trans-Saharan wealth. He was devout (Hajj, mosques), *and* a patron of learning (Timbuktu/Sankore). |
| Michael Collins | Philosophical, Organized | **Keep** | Administrative/intelligence-state profile; keep as-is. |
| Mao Zedong | Expansive, Protective | **Aggressive, Protective** | Mass campaigns and external war (Civil War, Korea), purges, and militant mobilization read more "Aggressive" than "cheap administration." Protective still captures internal security/defense posture. `<!-- custom: i like this one very much as i think he was very brutal wasn't he xd, from very little i know about him -->` |
| Mehmed | Expansive, Organized | **Imperialist, Organized** | For Mehmed II “the Conqueror”, I’d describe his personality as: ambitious, severe, intelligent, autocratic, cultured, strategic, and intensely empire-minded. He was not just a battlefield ruler. He captured Constantinople in 1453, expanded Ottoman power through the Balkans and Anatolia, and helped turn the Ottoman state into a more centralized imperial system. Britannica describes him as a great military leader and notes that he reorganized Ottoman government, codified laws, and became a model of the autocratic Ottoman emperor. At the same time, Mehmed was not simply a crude conqueror. He was interested in scholarship, law, architecture, theology, and classical/Renaissance learning. After taking Constantinople, he tried to restore the city as an imperial capital, invited scholars and artists to court, and patronized major building projects. So, in plain terms, his “personality” was something like: a ruthless intellectual conqueror who wanted to be both an Islamic sultan and a new Roman emperor. Organized: Excellent fit; Probably his best trait. Mehmed centralized government, codified law, rebuilt Constantinople, and strengthened the imperial structure. Imperialistic: Perfect alternate; Honestly, this may fit better than Expansive. He was literally “the Conqueror,” aimed at imperial restoration, and saw himself as heir to Rome. |
| Moctezuma | Aggressive, Spiritual | **Keep** | Militarism + ritual/faith. |
| Napoleon | Organized, Charismatic | **Imperialist, Charismatic** | Signature is conquest + continental empire (client states, annexations). He *did* codify/administer, but his core identity isn't "low-upkeep governance"-it's expansion + leadership aura. |
| Pacal | Financial, Expansive | **Financial, Industrious** | Monumental architecture/engineering + trade. |
| Pericles | Philosophical, Creative | **Keep** | Golden Age of philosophy and arts. |
| Peter | Philosophical, Expansive | **Philosophical, Organized** | For Peter the Great, I’d describe his personality as: curious, energetic, forceful, practical, reformist, impatient, authoritarian, and often brutal. Peter was obsessed with making Russia stronger by learning from Western Europe. He modernized the army and government, promoted technology, education, trade, and naval power, and founded St. Petersburg as a new western-facing capital. He also expanded Russian power through wars against Sweden, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia. But he was not a gentle reformer. He increased the monarchy’s power over nobles and the Orthodox Church, and some reforms were imposed harshly. Britannica notes that his reforms could be brutal and costly, and that he even had his own son Alexis tortured after suspecting him of conspiracy. So, in plain terms, Peter was: a restless modernizer who wanted to drag Russia into great-power status, whether people liked it or not. Not “philosopher” in the calm academic sense, but he was curious, technical, experimental, and obsessed with learning from foreign experts. He modernized administration, strengthened bureaucracy, reformed the army and state, and centralized authority. This may fit him even better than Philosophical. |
| Qin Shi Huang | Industrious, Protective | **Keep** | Great Wall/standardization + legalist control. |
| Ragnar | Financial, Aggressive | **Keep** | Raiding/commerce + martial ferocity. |
| Ramesses | Spiritual, Industrious | **Keep** | Temple/monument builder with priestly legitimation. |
| Roosevelt | Industrious, Organized | **Industrious, Charismatic** | New Deal public works -> keep Industrious. His defining edge was coalition-building and morale (Fireside Chats, wartime leadership) more than bureaucratic cost efficiency. |
| Saladin | Protective, Spiritual | **Spiritual, Charismatic** | Admired by both sides; unifying religious leadership - not just a "defender." He led major offensive campaigns (Hattin, Jerusalem) and had broad admiration. Your switch to Spiritual, Charismatic is very defensible; I wouldn't go back to Protective unless you want to emphasize "shield of Islam" over his rallying aura. |
| Shaka | Aggressive, Expansive | **Aggressive, Organized** | Fits Ikhanda-style admin - "charismatic" in Civ terms can imply inspirational popularity; historically he ruled more by fear/discipline. Your pick Aggressive, Organized is perfect (impi/regimental system + logistics). I wouldn't use Charismatic here. |
| Sitting Bull | Philosophical, Protective | **Keep** | Visionary/teacher + defensive resistance. |
| Stalin | Industrious, Aggressive | **Keep** | Forced industrialization + ruthless offensives. |
| Suleiman | Imperialist, Philosophical | **Keep** | "Lawgiver" persona + patronage of learning fits Philosophical better than Spiritual for gameplay and history; keeps imperial scope. `<!-- custom: plus if i remember enough i read he was quite areligious or religious open no? If so phi might fit better indeed than spi no? Thanks thanks -->` |
| Suryavarman | Expansive, Creative | **Industrious, Creative** | Builder of Angkor; monumental works + culture. |
| Tokugawa | Protective, Aggressive | **Protective, Organized** | After unification, policy emphasized internal order, class discipline, and isolation over external aggression; governance beats battlefield ferocity. `<!-- custom: from a very quick search and my intuition/memory of what i read about him, he was very cautious and cunning/scheming rather so maybe aggressive doesn't fit as well; also from a balance standpoint, if he is isolated, he would benefit much more from tax/costs reduction to run smoothly his empire than aggressive right? If i may say i mean -->` |
| Victoria | Imperialist, Financial | **Keep** | Global empire + finance/trade. |
| Wang Kon | Financial, Protective | **Keep** | For Wang Kon, better romanized today as Wang Geon, I’d describe his personality as: pragmatic, patient, diplomatic, conciliatory, strategic, religious, and quietly ambitious. He founded the Goryeo dynasty in 918 and completed the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms by receiving Silla’s surrender in 935 and defeating Later Baekje in 936. Unlike someone like Shaka or Genghis, Wang Geon’s image is less “destroy everything” and more absorb, reconcile, and stabilize. Britannica notes that he went to great lengths to absorb people from defeated states, which fits the picture of a coalition-building founder rather than a purely destructive conqueror. So in plain terms: Wang Kon was a unifier-king: military enough to win, diplomatic enough to keep the peace afterward. Financial: Strong fit; Goryeo became a durable kingdom with aristocratic, administrative, and economic foundations. Wang Kon’s strength was consolidation, not reckless expansion. Protective: Good fit; He unified Korea and then focused on stabilizing and securing the realm. Protective fits a ruler who builds a defensible state rather than constantly expanding outward. `<!-- custom: in terms of gameplay, protective (and financial to a lesser extent) also fits the more defensive korean gameplay with the as of now library-based civ-specific building and overall defensive unit, and thematically, this maybe also fits the broader theme of the protective trait (stability, conciliation, etc.). It also gives Korea more ancient power with (financial immediate scaling + protective immediate def) which may better align with the Ancient Korea history stressing change of the civ-specific building too. -->` |
| Washington | Expansive, Charismatic | **Protective, Charismatic** | Preservation-first Fabian strategy in the Revolution + 1777 army-wide smallpox inoculation (public-health safeguarding). Still inspirational. |
| Willem van Oranje | Creative, Financial | **Keep** | Tolerance/trade + arts/commerce. |
| Zara Yaqob | Creative, Organized | **Spiritual, Organized** | Strong doctrinal/religious policy + centralized rule - deeply doctrinal, centralizing, sometimes harsh. Spiritual, Organized > Creative. (He wrote and enforced doctrine more than fostering open culture.) |

## Leaders' favourite civics rework

Based on the old base advciv 1.12 data (or current advciv-sas if missing such as for new leaders we added like as of now Ewuare or such if any), check if accurate.

Goal is to make it more historically accurate, balanced in gameplay, and more or less evenly spread (although less of a focus but an additional ideal extra). Also to to account for our reworked/replaced civics such as of now civic_wage_labor, civic_trade_bloc, civic_protectionism, etc.

### after changes favourite civics per leader

Done with the help of chatgpt 5.1, and other ais for check-up such as claude sonnet 4.5 and grok 4.1 and others, and my reviewing or such as well i mean. Check if accurate.

note: as of now advciv-sas civics are (check if updated in Sevopedia/xml) wage labor is medieval new, protecitonism is late classical new (replaces mercantilism), environmentalism is removed in favour of trade_bloc (medieval (1300s) at printing press in our mod), and civic_paganism has been renamed to civic_prehistoric_religion (although it's as of now the same civic, just to distinguish/differentiate it from the religion_paganism we as of now added in advciv-sas).

Also i added this info from chatgpt 5.1's thoughts as i found it very accurate and nicely phrased thanks: "I think favorite civics should relate to the core of a leader's regime-such as government, legal, or religious systems-not just practices like slavery, which were widespread. For example, Caesar, Hannibal, and Pericles all had slavery-so choosing "Slavery" for one wouldn't add accuracy. Similarly, serfdom or trade bloc membership should be linked more to their regime and identity, not the specific labor practices of their time.".

| Leader | Current Favourite Civic | Recommendation | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alexander | Vassalage | **Keep** | Alexander's distinct pattern is: aristocratic companions who owe service for status/land, overlordship of allied Greek poleis and subject kings, use of a Persian-style layered hierarchy (satraps, sub-kings). In other words: a very militarised overlord + vassal network structure. Given that, I think Claude is right that our previous change doesn't really add clarity; it just makes him "generic monarch" instead of "overlord of vassals". I'd now revert Alexander back to Vassalage as favourite civic. That gives us one very clear "Vassalage leader" in the classical era (plus Ragnar etc.), and still leaves Hereditary Rule plenty represented elsewhere. `<!-- custom: note: based on claude sonnet 4.5's feedback -->` |
| Asoka | Free Religion | **Pacifism** | Post-Kalinga, Asoka is defined by renouncing conquest, promoting dhamma, and issuing moral edicts; a peace-focused religious civic captures his historical identity much better than a modern pluralist Free Religion. |
| Augustus | Representation | **Bureaucracy** | Augustus builds a durable imperial administration (provinces, census, tax, standing army) centered on Rome; Civ-style Bureaucracy is exactly "imperial capital + strong apparatus," which fits him far better than Representation. |
| Bismarck | Nationhood | **Keep** | His short, limited wars (1864, 1866, 1870-71) are national unification wars built on conscription and mass mobilization; "Nation in arms" plus post-1871 nation-state management fits Nationhood very well. |
| Boudica | Universal Suffrage | **Nationhood** | Historically she leads a revolt framed as defending "the people" and their land against Rome, rallying tribes into a war coalition; at Civ scale that is closer to a draft/war-mobilization civic than to late-game elections. We avoid Tribalism as a favourite because it's an empty civic in your mod. |
| Brennus | Organized Religion | **Vassalage** | I'd lean to changing Brennus to Vassalage - that gives him something more personal, and different from Boudica, without stretching what we actually know. For this Brennus (279 BCE, Thermopylae/Delphi one), the only clear thing in the sources is that he's a fearsome coalition war-leader. He commands a big multi-tribal force with subordinate chiefs and warbands - lots of personal loyalty and "follow this chieftain into Greece for plunder." We know far more about him as an overlord of warriors than as a religious organiser or nation-builder. So: Boudica = Nationhood -> "people's war / uprising of the Britons". Brennus = Vassalage -> "overlord with allied chiefs and retinues on campaign." That keeps them both Celtic and warlike, but with distinctly different regime "shapes". `<!-- custom: based on my past research, Brennus was fairly areligious, so after pointing/suggesting/asking chatgpt 5.1 this question/point, it told me organized religion works as a celtic society broad abstraction but not so typical of brennus himself who was not known for his piety or such if i understood it correctly. Since i want something more personalized to leaders ideally, changed it from the old organized religion then instead of keeping same trait. It then rereviewed the table again with this perspective/idea in mind and no other change needed for accuracy or such according to it, except for Cyrus (see his line for details) check if accurate thanks for help lot still chatgpt 5.1: -->` "Short answer: with the Brennus change, I don't see any other leader where the current favourite civic clearly misses their personal/regime identity in the way "Organized Religion -> Brennus" did.". |
| Catherine | Hereditary Rule | **Keep** | Whatever her Enlightenment correspondence, she is an autocratic empress whose legitimacy rests on dynastic monarchy and palace coups; Hereditary Rule is exactly that. |
| Charlemagne | Vassalage | **Keep** | Carolingian rule is the textbook example of counts, marcher lords, and benefices granted for service; Vassalage is one of the most accurate favourite civic matches in the entire roster. |
| Churchill | Nationhood | **Keep** | Churchill's moment is wartime Britain: mass conscription, propaganda, and appeals to "the nation" rather than technocratic administration or economics. Nationhood fits that role. |
| Cyrus | Vassalage | **Hereditary Rule** | Cyrus is a dynastic "King of Kings" ruling through satraps but anchored in royal lineage; in your civic set, simple Hereditary Rule is a closer abstraction than medieval-style Vassalage. `<!-- custom: following note at brennus: -->` "Right, so the "conflicted" feeling with Cyrus is basically: he looks like a Vassalage guy (King of Kings + satraps), but he is first and foremost a dynastic monarch. What Cyrus actually did (very condensed)" + "He overthrew the Median king, then conquered Lydia and Babylon, creating the Achaemenid Empire in the mid-6th c. BCE. To hold all that together, he used satraps - regional governors - to rule provinces on his behalf. The Achaemenid kings used the title "King of Kings" (shahanshah / basileus ton basileon), signalling that there were other kings beneath them - local dynasts and city-kings who stayed in place as subordinates. He's also famous (maybe a bit romantically) for relatively lenient policies toward conquered peoples - e.g. letting exiles return and respecting local cults (Cyrus Cylinder, Jewish return from Babylon, etc.). So structurally, that does smell a lot like Civ's Vassalage: a top ruler with subordinate rulers owing service." + "So the conflict is: Vassalage captures the shape of his empire. Hereditary Rule captures the core of his kingship and keeps Darius as the administrative/system guy. On balance, for your goals (personalised, regime-identity-focused, and avoiding too much overlap with Darius), Hereditary Rule wins by a nose. If someday you introduce a second Persian leader focused on the "network of subject kings" angle, that one would be a great place to use Vassalage as their favourite." |
| Darius | Free Religion | **Bureaucracy** | Darius is the system-builder: satrapies, royal roads, inspectors, standardized tribute. His key trait is administrative statecraft, not modern religious liberty; Bureaucracy fits that centralizing impulse. |
| De Gaulle | Nationhood | **Keep** | From the Free French to the Fifth Republic, his whole persona is "voice of the nation" and institutional refounder; a national-mobilization civic suits him well. |
| Elizabeth | Free Religion | **Free Market** | Her reign is the birth of English global commerce: chartered companies, privateering, Atlantic ventures. A trade-centric economic civic (Free Market) better captures the "Elizabethan sea-trade" identity than a modern secular religion policy. |
| Ewuare | Hereditary Rule | **Keep** | The Oba of Benin is a sacral, hereditary monarch whose power rests on lineage, court ritual, and palace institutions; that is straight Hereditary Rule in Civ terms. |
| Frederick | Universal Suffrage | **Bureaucracy** | Frederick the Great is the archetypal "enlightened despot" running a drill-state and efficient civil service; he is much more a bureaucratic monarch than any kind of democrat. |
| Gandhi | Universal Suffrage | **Pacifism** | Gandhi's historical persona centers on non-violent resistance, fasting, and moral pressure, not on holding office inside a voting system; a peace-oriented religious civic is a cleaner expression of his role. |
| Genghis Khan | Police State | **Keep** | Mongol rule under Genghis is total war, harsh law, and near-total social mobilization; Police State is a very accurate Civ-level abstraction. |
| Gilgamesh | Hereditary Rule | **Keep** | Bronze Age Uruk is a city-state under a semi-divine king; a basic hereditary monarchy fits that legendary setting well enough. |
| Hammurabi | Bureaucracy | **Keep** | He is literally the go-to example for codified law and early centralized administration; Bureaucracy is exactly what his Civ design is already gesturing at. |
| Hannibal | Free Market | **Keep** | If you keep the current meaning of "Trade Bloc" (intergovernmental economic union), I still think Hannibal -> Free Market is more accurate than Hannibal -> Trade Bloc. Why I'd still lean Hannibal = Free Market" + "Given your own rule: favourite civic = the thing that best captures the leader's regime identity or vibe, not "we need to showcase this civic" then for Hannibal: Core Hannibal / Carthage vibe: Maritime merchant city-empire" + "Money + ports + trade routes fund mercenary armies" + "Carthage as a rich commercial power clashing with a land empire (Rome)" + "Conceptually that is much closer to: Free Market -> "commerce-driven society where markets and trade dominate the economy" than to: Trade Bloc -> "formal intergovernmental agreement / customs union between multiple states"" + "Your Trade Bloc pedia text (screenshot) is very explicitly about: USMCA, EU-style blocs, 19-20th century economic integration, regional organisations, etc. Carthage's system is an imperial maritime network, not an institutional trade bloc among equal partners. So if we stay literal about the concept as written, Hannibal's "dream civic" is still Free Market." + "Given everything you've told me about accuracy > symmetry, my honest recommendation is still: Hannibal -> Free Market, zero Trade Bloc favourites is OK." |
| Hatshepsut | Organized Religion | **Keep** | Her major beats are Punt expeditions, temple building, and religious legitimation of her rule; a "temples help build things" civic matches that temple-economy flavor well. |
| Huayna Capac | Hereditary Rule | **State Property** | The Inca economy is state-planned: no private land, labor tax (mit'a), state storehouses and roads. A command-economy civic like State Property maps far better to that than a generic monarchy favourite. |
| Isabella | Theocracy | **Keep** | Reconquista, Inquisition, and militant Catholic policy: she is almost the archetype for a Theocracy in Civ terms. |
| Joao | Hereditary Rule | **Free Market** | Portuguese expansion under Joao leans into Atlantic trade, colonies, and commercial charters; a pro-commerce economic civic is a better summary than another monarchy tag. |
| Julius Caesar | Representation | **Police State** | In practice Caesar's regime is a personal dictatorship backed by loyal legions and proscriptions; a hardline Police State matches that concentration of power better than a representative-government civic. |
| Justinian | Theocracy | **Keep** | He rules an explicitly Christian empire, sponsors councils, enforces orthodoxy, and fuses imperial and religious authority; Theocracy is on-point here. |
| Kublai Khan | Bureaucracy | **Keep** | As Yuan emperor he leans heavily on Chinese imperial bureaucracy and civil officials; Bureaucracy is exactly the flavor you want to highlight for him. |
| Lincoln | Emancipation | **Nationhood** | Lincoln's presidency is the archetype of "save the Union" via mass mobilization: conscription, war bonds, and appeals to the nation; a draft/propaganda civic expresses that better than a labor-law civic. |
| Louis XIV | Hereditary Rule | **Keep** | "L'etat, c'est moi" is pure absolutist monarchy; Hereditary Rule is the clean and accurate match. |
| Mansa Musa | Free Market | **Keep** | His fame comes from gold, caravans, and trade routes linking West Africa to the wider Islamic world; a trade-oriented economic civic suits him perfectly. Mansa Musa - Free Market vs Trade Bloc: I agree with your current choice: Free Market. His story is gold + caravans + pilgrimage and wealth, not designing a customs union. |
| Mao Zedong | State Property | **Keep** | Mao leads a communist revolution and then rules a centrally planned economy with collectivization and five-year plans; State Property is exactly the canonical choice. |
| Mehmed | Vassalage | **Hereditary Rule** | Mehmed II is a dynastic Ottoman sultan; while he does rely on timar grants and provincial notables, the core structure is an hereditary sultanate, which fits Hereditary Rule better than medieval Vassalage. |
| Moctezuma | Police State | **Theocracy** | The Aztec state fuses ruler and priesthood, with ritual war and sacrifice as religious duty; a state-religion fusion civic better captures that sacral militarism than a generic police regime. |
| Napoleon | Representation | **Nationhood** | Napoleon is the poster child for levee en masse and national armies fighting for "la nation"; Nationhood captures the mass-mobilization aspect of Napoleonic France more clearly than any formal representative system. |
| Pacal | Hereditary Rule | **Caste System** | Classic Maya society is strongly stratified with nobles, priests, and commoners in fixed roles; a labor/social-stratification civic like Caste System is a closer abstraction than a generic monarchy favourite. |
| Pericles | Representation | **Keep** | Periclean Athens stands in for democracy in Civ: assembly, juries, pay for civic service; using Representation for that is standard and thematically right. |
| Peter | Bureaucracy | **Keep** | Peter the Great is all about building a Western-style, centrally administered state (Table of Ranks, new capital, modernized army); Bureaucracy is a perfect description. |
| Qin Shi Huang | Bureaucracy | **Police State** | Qin unification is remembered for harsh Legalist law, forced labor, book burnings, and secret police; in your civic set that's closer to a hard Police State than to neutral "capital gets extra commerce." |
| Ragnar | Hereditary Rule | **Vassalage** | Viking warbands and jarls revolve around personal loyalty and service to a war-leader; Civ's Vassalage (lords owing military service) is a good abstraction for that retinue-based society. |
| Ramesses | Organized Religion | **Keep** | Ramesses II is temple and monument king, backed by priestly legitimation; staying with Organized Religion keeps the "temple economy builds big things" vibe intact. |
| Roosevelt | Mercantilism | **Universal Suffrage** | FDR governs within a mature electoral democracy, re-elected multiple times and using the state to intervene in the economy; a modern democratic government civic fits his role better than a narrow trade-policy one. |
| Saladin | Theocracy | **Keep** | He's remembered as the pious unifier leading jihad and defending Jerusalem; a tight fusion of state and religion is exactly what Theocracy represents. |
| Shaka | Police State | **Keep** | Shaka's Zulu state is a hyper-militarized regimental society with intense discipline and coercion; Police State is a very accurate Civ-scale summary. |
| Sitting Bull | Environmentalism | **Nationhood** | In Civ terms he stands for defending his people's land and sovereignty against an expanding state; a "defend the nation/people" civic matches that resistance role better than a late-game environmental/trade-bloc civic. |
| Stalin | State Property | **Keep** | Stalin's USSR is the classic example of full state ownership and command planning; State Property is the obvious and accurate favourite. |
| Suleiman | Hereditary Rule | **Bureaucracy** | Suleiman "the Lawgiver" is as much about kanun (imperial law) and administrative order as conquest; highlighting a capital-centered admin civic better reflects that than another generic monarchy favourite. |
| Suryavarman | Caste System | **Keep** | Angkor-era Khmer society is highly hierarchical with temple elites and organized labor; Caste System is a good abstraction for that social order. |
| Tokugawa | Mercantilism | **Protectionism** | The Tokugawa shogunate's sakoku policy (closed borders, tightly controlled trade) is basically a protectionist, restricted-trade order; your Protectionism civic maps to that very cleanly and replaces Mercantilism in the mod. |
| Victoria | Representation | **Free Market** | Victorian Britain is the textbook 19th-century industrial capitalist and free-trade power (post-Corn Laws etc.); a pro-market economic civic captures that better than tweaking the government form. |
| Wang Kon | Caste System | **Organized Religion** | As founder of Goryeo he strongly supports Buddhism and religious institutions as pillars of the state; a temple-driven Organized Religion civic fits his Spiritual/Organized flavor better than labor structure alone. |
| Washington | Free Speech | **Representation** | Washington presides over the founding of a representative republic and then voluntarily steps down; a government civic representing representative institutions is the cleanest expression of his role. |
| Willem van Oranje | Free Religion | **Keep** | He's famous for religious tolerance and coalition politics in the Dutch Revolt; a pluralist Free Religion civic is exactly his slot. |
| Zara Yaqob | Theocracy | **Keep** | Zara Yaqob is known for enforcing strict Christian orthodoxy and writing doctrinal works; a strong state-church fusion civic is the right summary. |

- sanity: leaders listed in this table = **53** (one favourite civic per leader)

## Leaders' Favourite religions rework

This is the oldest rework i made and which i had made without AI if i remember it correctly at least at that time, unlike how i did it later as of now for the other reworks in this doc.

Since its structure and way of doing it was quite differently done (not using chatgpt or such to web search info but digging myself if i remember it correctly) (note: chatgpt 5.1 helped me a bit to find some typoes or such here and then as of now to format and summarize the already existing data into a table or such), adding them here in the doc after these other reworks.

### notes_about_religious_design

#### Brennus

According to this document [https://boutique.tropismes.com/bonus/extrait/9782812148347](https://boutique.tropismes.com/bonus/extrait/9782812148347), page 29, Gaul leaders/chiefs (maybe that includes brennus of the Gaul too?) did not exert a strong religious pressure on their people as they were driven by freedom if i understand it correctly.

If this accurate and reliable, i may want/have/need to change brennus's xml to focus less on religion and more on civis, perhaps even boudica's but there may be more data on her since she is more recent, and i didn't look yet (at least not in detail, only that she was seemingly more religious at least than what i know now of brenus if this doc is accurate, but it was quick glance too on boudica anyways so may look later or maybe not though.), so may apply this to brennus only or other similar leaders or not.

Note: in advciv-sas as of now confucianism has been removed and replaced with paganism religion.

#### Churchill

From a quick search not detailed, churchill didn't seem to have a strong preference for it or any religion, so is none now, allows also to declutter christianity that was bloated.

#### Cyrus

cyrus seems to not be strongly religious and quite open too in/from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great#Religion_and_philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great#Religion_and_philosophy).

#### Darius

it seems darius is a bit more religious though (at least than cyrus), in these sources:

- [http://www.teheran.ir/spip.php?article2533#gsc.tab=0](http://www.teheran.ir/spip.php?article2533#gsc.tab=0)
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Achaemenid_Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Achaemenid_Empire)

#### Ewuare

as for Ewuare (kingdom of benin), christianity seems to be an important part of the kingdom, but the beninese also have their own kind of or own religion with human sacrifices ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin#Human_sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin#Human_sacrifice)) or such, plus their benin bronzes and such; makes me more lean towards the fact that (THEY) they were more pagans, so going with that instead.

#### Frederick

frederick seems to be agnostic (quite strongly xd from the very little read i had here (in french) which is quite funny, the ironic pleasantry/plaisanterie in his letter): [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_II_(roi_de_Prusse)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_II_(roi_de_Prusse)); but i read little about it and this page seems enough to say he is agnostic indeed maybe, but seems a bit enough.

update: since i can't find what this refers to at a quick glance, i now asked chatgpt 5.1 about it still no luck xd. My best guess is in one of his correspondances with someone else he noted how something is ironic or paradoxical, this is how i remember it but nothing specific, maybe i should have written it or maybe not since i didn't. At least i tried xd maybe i mean.

#### Genghis Khan

genghis khan seems to have been tengrist something, but according to a quick search, it seems he had great respect for daoism: [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_en_Mongolie#Tao%C3%AFsme](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_en_Mongolie#Tao%C3%AFsme)

>Bien que Gengis Khan ait ete avant tout tengriste, il manifesta un grand respect a l'egard du dirigeant de la secte taoiste Quanzhen, Qiu Chuji, lorsque celui-ci lui rendit visite dans l'Hindou Kouch, a Kaboul, en 1222, a son invitation, et predit la conquete de la Chine par les Mongols. En retour, Gengis Khan lui donna d'importants pouvoirs politiques et religieux. Il fut exempte de taxes, et depuis Pekin, sa secte fut la plus favorisee de l'Empire Mongol. Il defendit la liberte d'autogestion des autres sectes, aupres du khagan, qu'il s'agisse des taoistes, des bouddhistes, des chretiens nestoriens ou des musulmans[18].

therefore, it is not incorrect to say, among civ4 advciv-sas's religions in particular, hat his favourite religion, if he had to choose one, is not none but maybe rather indeed daoism, is also quie convenient even though was not main goal that this is not filled., one leader can have a favourite religion even though not having said religion themselves; this is perhaps an important distinction i should add in changelogs and added now.

#### Lincoln

as for lincoln, according to sources i read, lincoln was not christian, not strongly enough at all at least, here are a few sources i read:

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Abraham_Lincoln#:~:text=Although%20Lincoln%20never%20made%20an,Christ%20in%20the%20religious%20sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Abraham_Lincoln#:~:text=Although%20Lincoln%20never%20made%20an,Christ%20in%20the%20religious%20sense)
- [https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/LegislativeMoments/moments09RS/web/Lincoln%20moments%206.pdf](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/LegislativeMoments/moments09RS/web/Lincoln%20moments%206.pdf)
- [https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/was-abraham-lincoln-a-christian/](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/was-abraham-lincoln-a-christian/)
- [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/llardq/til_that_abraham_lincolns_religious_views_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/llardq/til_that_abraham_lincolns_religious_views_are/)

i did not look at them in (long) detail, but i think in detail enough hopefully. that i can assert quite faithfully/strongly but anyways maybe that he was definitely leaning more agnostic than christian, reddit comments also lean in that direction, was not christian even though had a strong christian education. Lincoln seems more agnostic or not strongly favouring a religion, so for civ4 i changed it to none rather than christianity, he seems to be a free person rather which i like i mean. (But also even if he were not such free man and really christian, he is free to do so to (else it would defeat the purpose xd i mean.)).

#### Pericles

pericles prefers religion according to [https://ehne.fr/fr/eduscol/pericles-est-il-vraiment-le-grand-homme-de-la-democratie-athenienne#:~:text=Enfin%2C%20P%C3%A9ricl%C3%A8s%20s'est%20appuy%C3%A9,ont%20beaucoup%20fait%20pour%20la](https://ehne.fr/fr/eduscol/pericles-est-il-vraiment-le-grand-homme-de-la-democratie-athenienne#:~:text=Enfin%2C%20P%C3%A9ricl%C3%A8s%20s'est%20appuy%C3%A9,ont%20beaucoup%20fait%20pour%20la) so going with religion paganism hopefully accurate enough.

#### Wang Kon

for wang kon, according to civ4 wiki (in [https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Wang_Kon_(Civ4)](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Wang_Kon_(Civ4))):

>During his reign Wang Kon promoted Buddhism as the state religion, and oversaw the conquest of northern Korea and parts of Manchuria. When dealing with local clans,

he promoted buddhism as the state religion; i don't know why his preferred religion was confucianism, but since there is no confucianism anymore now in advciv-sas, he leans closer (i think) to buddhism based on this maybe. than say paganism or none religion (favourite), is convenient to increase buddhism leader count that is really low and not increase paganism leader count that is high enough (a bit too high but historically fine and matching christinaity so maybe fine too); Hopefully fine enough and accurate enough even though not exhaustive.

### Other leaders

Not documented in my old notes (sometimes as of now directly in XML code comments near `<FavoriteReligion>` it seems (but check to be sure)), but many leaders have also been changed, mostly if not only to paganism.

### Summary of the favourite religion leaders' changes in advciv-sas

A summary of my previous notes with the help of chatgpt 5.1 (check if accurate), showing base advciv's (except for some leader(s) like Ewuare since they didn't exist in base advciv) favourite religion vs advciv-sas.

| Leader | Base | New | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alexander | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Asoka | Buddhism | Keep | |
| Augustus | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Bismarck | Christianity | Keep | |
| Boudica | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Brennus | None | Keep | Already had no favourite religion; the Brennus note mainly informed other XML tweaks (less religious emphasis, more civics focus), not a favourite religion change. |
| Catherine | Christianity | Keep | |
| Charlemagne | Christianity | Keep | |
| Churchill | Christianity | **None** | Biographical sketches don't show a strong personal attachment to any one faith; dropping his Christian favourite both matches that and helps reduce Christianity's over-representation in the roster. |
| Cyrus | None | Keep | After a quick read of his religious views, Cyrus looks relatively open and not strongly attached to a single faith, so leaving his favourite religion as None still fits. |
| Darius | None | **Paganism** | Darius appears more overtly religious than Cyrus in the sources; giving him a specific favourite religion in-game (Paganism as generic Achaemenid state cult) reflects that. |
| De Gaulle | Christianity | Keep | |
| Elizabeth | Christianity | Keep | |
| Ewuare | | **Paganism** | New leader in AdvCiv-SAS; for the Kingdom of Benin, Christianity appears late and local religion (including human sacrifice and royal ritual) is central, so Ewuare uses Paganism as favourite religion. |
| Frederick | Christianity | **None** | French and other sources often describe Frederick II as deist/agnostic; his favourite religion is changed from Christianity to None to reflect that more sceptical stance. |
| Gandhi | Hinduism | Keep | |
| Genghis Khan | None | **Daoism** | Historically tengrist but showed particular respect for the Quanzhen Daoist master Qiu Chuji; among your available religions, Daoism is the closest fit, and it usefully fills what was previously an empty favourite-religion slot for him. |
| Gilgamesh | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Grace O'Malley | | **None** | New leader in AdvCiv-SAS; no favourite religion in current XML. |
| Hammurabi | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Hannibal | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Hatshepsut | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Huayna Capac | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Isabella | Christianity | Keep | |
| Joao | Christianity | Keep | |
| Julius Caesar | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Justinian | Christianity | Keep | |
| Kublai Khan | Buddhism | Keep | |
| Lincoln | Christianity | **None** | Sources generally paint Lincoln as religiously complex / sceptical rather than a clear Christian partisan; treating him as effectively agnostic and removing his Christian favourite keeps him more neutral. |
| Louis XIV | Christianity | Keep | |
| Mansa Musa | Islam | Keep | |
| Mao Zedong | None | Keep | |
| Mehmed | Islam | Keep | |
| Michael Collins | | **Christianity** | New leader in AdvCiv-SAS; Christianity in current XML. |
| Moctezuma | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Napoleon | Christianity | Keep | |
| Pacal | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Pericles | None | **Paganism** | Pericles leans heavily on civic religion, festivals and public cult; giving him Paganism as a favourite ties him to the generic "classical city cults" bucket instead of leaving him without any religious preference. |
| Peter | Christianity | Keep | |
| Qin Shi Huang | Taoism | **Daoism** | Taoism was renamed Daoism in AdvCiv-SAS. |
| Ragnar | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Ramesses | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Roosevelt | Christianity | Keep | |
| Saladin | Islam | Keep | |
| Shaka | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Sitting Bull | None | **Paganism** | Not documented in [notes_about_religious_design](/_1_AdvCiv-SAS/Docs/README_Assets_Rebalancing.md#notes_about_religious_design). |
| Stalin | None | Keep | |
| Suleiman | Islam | Keep | |
| Suryavarman | Hinduism | Keep | |
| Tokugawa | Buddhism | Keep | |
| Victoria | Christianity | Keep | |
| Wang Kon | Confucianism | **Buddhism** | As founder of Goryeo he promoted Buddhism as state religion; with Confucianism removed from AdvCiv-SAS, switching his favourite to Buddhism keeps him anchored to an organised religion that matches the history better than Paganism or None. |
| Washington | Christianity | Keep | |
| Willem van Oranje | Christianity | Keep | |
| Zara Yaqob | Christianity | Keep | |
