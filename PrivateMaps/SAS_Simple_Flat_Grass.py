# <!-- custom: Playable simple flat-grass sandbox wrapper for the compact almost-all-land profile in Assets/Python/SAS_WorldSizeUtils.py. Keep reusable helper logic out of this PrivateMaps file: Civ4 treats top-level functions here as map-script callbacks, and the old helper-map/import-star design leaked this file's compact getGridSize into unrelated scripts. RandomScriptMap Huge was empirically too small (60 x 44) until the split restored 120 x 84, visually matching base AdvCiv Huge at a glance; the same leak likely affected other scripts such as Archipelago.
