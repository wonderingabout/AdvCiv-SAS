# AI, UI, or other modifications
# Created as part of AdvCiv-SAS improvements
# (c) 2026 wonderingabout & AI helpers (see Authors in root README.md)
#
# <!-- custom: moved to a separate files these we compute these only once fairly independently from external variables, and return a list at the end anyway, which seems much cleaner to do as a separate file rather, with the help of ChatGPT-5.2 Thinking thanks a lot -->
#
# SevoPedia main-list grouping helpers.
# - Purpose: keep SevoPediaMain.py smaller/cleaner by moving "grouping once" logic here.
# - Design: NO imports from SevoPediaMain (avoids circular deps). Use module-scope `gc` + a few flags.
# - Python: keep Civ4/BUG Python 2.4 compatibility (xrange, cmp sorts, etc.).
#
# Expected usage from SevoPediaMain:
#   import _sevopedia_main_groupings as SAS_MainGroupings
#   ... then call SAS_MainGroupings.<func>(..., self.isSortLists(), ...)
#
# <!-- custom: For grouping helpers that accept a prebuilt baseList, SevoPediaMain already applies BUG 'Sort Lists' ordering once via getSortedList()/getUnfilteredSortedList().
# These helpers therefore preserve the incoming order and do not re-sort, avoiding redundant work when list grouping is enabled. (ChatGPT-5.2 Thinking) -->

We bucket the building into the LATEST (max) era among these prereq techs, so it shows up in the era when it actually becomes buildable.
	# Empirical sanity check: we tested a building with two widely separated PrereqTech and TechTypes (e.g. TECH_MATHEMATICS (Classical) and TECH_FUSION (Future)) in both permutations (A then B, and B then A), and in both cases the building was listed under the later era (Future), confirming the "max era of prereqs" rule behaves correctly in practice.
	# Additional sanity check: we also tested <PrereqTech>NONE</PrereqTech> with an existing TechTypes prereq (i.e. only the <TechTypes> prereq was set), and the building was still listed under the correct era, confirming the fallback scan of getPrereqAndTechs(i) works even when the main <PrereqTech> is NONE. -->
